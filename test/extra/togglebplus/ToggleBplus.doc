Welcome to the ToggleBplus package for Motif 1.1 or 1.2!
This is the preliminary release 0.91

If you're in doubt, the primary source of this widget is
    ftp.igpm.rwth-aachen.de (134.130.161.30)
    The source is in: /arc/pub/unix/motif/ToggleBplus.tar.gz
This is our institute's ftp server - an old novell server, so be nice
with it.

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION CAREFULLY!

QUESTION:
* Can't your customers tell the difference between a square shaped and a
  diamond shaped indicator toggle buttons usually display?
* Or can't your customers distinguish when an indicator is in the "on" state?
* Can't you bear the toggle button's outer appearance (hehehe) ?

ANSWER:
  Just get rid of the old XmToggleButtons and use this free add-on instead.
  It modifies XmToggleButtons such by setting some resources and adding
  new translations that it gets a much better look. Now your customers easily
  recognize (and remark!) the difference between toggle buttons used for either
  exclusive or multiple choice.

  One big mistake the OSF made, was to use rectangular shapes for both
  selection modes (XmONE_OF_MANY, XmN_OF_MANY). This results in a somewhat
  cumbersome recognizing process on beside of the user - not a good design
  goal with graphical user interfaces that are always claiming the
  opposite.

  Thus the new XmToggleButton displays a checkbox whenever it is part of a
  multiple choice selection. When in exclusive mode the new toggle button
  widget draws a round button instead which looks much like the buttons
  known from old radios.

NOTE:
  This package is completely different from the NewToggleButton package
  I've developed some time ago. That former package had to fight against
  lots of bugs and shortcommings in Motif, especially with different Motif
  releases subclassing off XmToggleButton turned out to be almost impossible.
  This new package circumvents this by using the existing XmToggleButton
  class and modifies the resource settings as well as it replaces some
  translations to get the whole thing working.

1. To compile you will need at least Motif :-)
   (or :-( depending on your point of view...)
   and an *ANSI* c compiler (the code is completely ANSI - no more mess 
   with the old K&R style)! First edit the Makefile and change the
   settings to reflect your platform's configuration. Then do a simple
   $ make
   This will build a short demo application called demo as well as the
   object file for the new toggle button: ToggleBplus.o.
   When all runs fine copy the object file as well as the header file to
   a suitable place (maybe the Xm/ directory, ;-) again!)
   
2. To use the ToggleBplus package within your own applications put a
     #include <ToggleBplus.h> 
   where necessary. Then use the new call
     XmCreateToggleButtonPlus(...)
   instead of the old one:
     XmCreateToggleButton(...)
     
3. You should always provide a suitable setting for the selectColor
   resource. It defaults to a light gray on color screens. Whereas this
   is approbiate for the old toggle button it's a mess with the new
   design. You should provide a fallback setting, e.g. set selectColor
   to red, yellow or even blue. This will provide enough contrast to
   the surrounding background.

P.S.: This software is Free Software. Please refer to the file
      COPYING, which you should have received together this
      file and the source code of the combo box widget.
      However if you find this widget to be usefull, you are encouraged
      to donate a reasonable amount to a charitable institution --
      there are enough people out there who need help! Sometimes I got
      the strong impression that programmers tend to get lost in their
      own "virtual reality" - sitting in front of their screen, hacking
      new algorithms and forget about everything around them. So please
      don't forget about people who need help.
