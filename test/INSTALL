This tree should be placed directly under the lesstif main source directory.

If used together with the LessTif main source distributions just follow
the instructions given in the main INSTALL file.
Otherwise you may first have to run "./CVSMake" and then ./configure.
In case the configure script already exists you may skip the first step.
