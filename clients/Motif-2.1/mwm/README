This is LessTif's mwm.  It is derived from fvwm, with a new parser that
understands mwmrc syntax, and a general understanding of Mwm resources.
The window manager is freely redistributable;  see the file COPYING for
details.

You should know and understand both mwmrc syntax and Mwm resource
specifications if you want to modify mwm's behavior.

I departed from mwm's specification in that all window decorations have
separate resources; see the Mwm resource file for examples of this.

If you are familiar with fvwm, you'll notice the modules are gone; I didn't
particularly like the IPC mechanism.  The virtual screen and the
builtin pager are still there; you can turn off the pager, and the virtual
screen, via judicious use of some not-quite-mwm resources.

  If you don't want/don't like the pager, set the Mwm*usePager resource to
    False (or uncomment the line in Mwm that does this).

  If you don't like the panning mechanism (virtual screen), set the
    edgeScrollX/edgeScrollY resources to 0 (or uncomment the lines in Mwm
    that do this).  That will disable panning.  The edgeScroll resources
    default to the width of the screen; setting smaller values will pan
    the screen in smaller increments than one full page.

  If you prefer fvwm's "smart placement" policy, you can enable the
    Mwm*smartPlacement resource to true (or uncomment the line in mwm
    that does this).

Some of the additional flags that fvwm provides are still included, and likely
will not go away.  They are specified by the resource "clientFlags".  These
include:
    "sticky",
    "circulate_skip",
    "start_iconic",
    "list_skip"
The pager is "sticky" by default:  you'll have to change code if you don't like
this.

To use this version of mwm:
 o - copy the file 'system.mwmrc' to $HOME/.mwmrc (or to
     MWM_DDIR/system.mwmrc) and make any modifications that you prefer.

 o - Copy Mwm to your app-defaults directory, again making any modifications
     that you prefer (note: not all resources do anything yet, so don't be
     surprised if you request something and it doesn't happen.  All uncommented
     resources are working.  Those commented may work, or may yet require
     changes to libXm).  If you've been using lesstif's mwm for sometime, I'd
     advise copying the latest one in.  See comments in Mwm for details.

 o - If you haven't mapped your Alt keys to a modifier yet, use the provided
     alt.map file.  You can add the line
	xmodmap /usr/X11R6/lib/mwm/alt.map
     to your xinitrc to get this mapping consistently (assuming that you put
     alt.map somewhere logical).  There are other ways to do this; use
     whichever you prefer.  Unlike OSF/M*tif, you can bind any modifier to
     the Alt key in LessTif; so feel free to replace the Mod1 mapping in
     alt.map to whatever you prefer (thanks, Harald, for the clues in VirtKeys).

Things that work:
  o - menus.  Not all functions are implemented, so not all Motif functions
      work.
  o - button bindings in general.  Specifically, work needs to be done to
      pay attention to up/down/click/click2.
  o - resource specification work, but not all resources are paid attention
      to.
  o - key bindings work.  WARNING: if you use XFree86 on Linux, be aware
      that the server eats (Ctrl+Alt) sequences (or the console does; I'm
      not sure which), so some mwm accelerators may not work for you.
  o - defaults, resource conversion, colors.  The resource converters are
      sort of crude.  If someone has some free time, take a look at
      resources.c: anyplace you see strstr(), the function needs work (hint:
      split the string, then use strcmp()).
  o - font resources.
  o - multiscreen behavior is working, but screen specific resources aren't
      handled yet.
  o - If you didn't know, the pager is Input/Output.  Clicking on a window's
      representation in the pager will set the focus to that window.  Even
      clicking on a virtual screen will page you to that screen.
      

Things that don't work:
  o - icons are sort of a general problem.
  o - bugs, bugs, bugs.
  o - everything else I've forgotten:).
