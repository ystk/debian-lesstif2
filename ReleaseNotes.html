<h2>Release 0.95.2 (May 27, 2009 paul)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Maintainance release.
<li> Reverted a patch from lesstif 0.93.96 to 0.93.97 which resulted in 
  bug 1578451, crashes on pressing <ESC> in menus.
<li> Fixed several 64 bit issues.
<li> Fixed a number of security issues (signed unsigned comparions) in the
  Xpm reading code (CAN-2005-0605)
<li> Fixed use of accels with more then one modifier
<li> Fixed the layout of applications with widgets which have the AttachBottom
  set to AttachSelf, this fixes using z88 with lesstif.
<li> Fixed VendorSP.h inclusion from cpp code
<li> Silenced Xt warnings on unnecessary ungrab (xpdf)
<li> Fixed a crash in xim chained lists.
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.95.0 (June 10, 2006 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> We're now also distributing a version of LessTif packaged with
     <A HREF="http://www.autopackage.org">autopackage</A>.
     Fixes to the autopackage/default.apspec.in were applied for this,
     and the autopackage team augmented their implementation for us (thanks!).
<li> Change the API of the _LtDebugPrintRenderTable function, the old one
     wasn't working well.
<li> Add a dependency so ResConvert.c is compiled whenever configure.in changes.
<li> Make the message from configure about missing or too old X development
     packages mention the missing case too.
     Happens more often than old versions nowadays. 
<li> Add code to the release script to create an autopackage file.
<li> Add code to the release script to create RPMs automatically.
<li> Fix and clean up some of the XmStringCreate functions, they weren't handling
     tabs and newlines correctly. (Bug #1037816 XmStringCreateLtoR and
     XmStringGenerate NL broken).
<li> Implement XmStringGenerate() and XmStringParseText() somewhat better.
<li> Fix an initialisation problem with RenderTables which caused colour
     settings to fail in some circumstances.
<li> Fix a bug that caused XmTextField to overwrite its border.
<li> Remove a couple of fprintf statements saying "Yow"
<li> Fix freetype installation check which appears to require #include <ft2built.h>.
<li> Fix the build so it won't override defaults from libtool (bug #1331548).
<li> Bug #1312056 - add an #include for Solaris on x86.
<li> Fix compile error in TextOut.c when compiling with Xft.
<li> RPM specfile syntax has renamed Copyright into License.
<li> Patch by Eric Branlund for _MOTIF_DRAG_TARGETS on x86_64.
<li> Patches by Winfried to fix warnings detected with GCC 4.
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.94.4 (March 31, 2005 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Nothing to report yet. <!-- Replace this line -->
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.94.2 (March 30, 2005 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Add scripts/motif-config as suggested on comp.windows.x.motif .
<li> Add _MOTIF_DEFAULT_LOCALE in Xm/Xm.h
<li> Add support for the XmQTspecifyRenderTable trait in XmMenuShell, XmVendorShell,
     and XmBulletinBoard.
<li> Implement XmeGetDefaultRenderTable().
<li> Improve the string-to-rendertable converter so it also picks up unqualified resources. 
     Until now it only converted stuff like
     <pre>
         *One.renderTable: green, variable
         *One.renderTable.green.renditionForeground: Green
     </pre>
     now it also should convert
     <pre>
         *One.renderTable:
         *One.renderTable.renditionForeground: Green
     </pre>
     In the latter case, the rendition's tag is _MOTIF_DEFAULT_LOCALE.
<li> Add a string to font-type converter (FONT_IS_FONTSET and such).
<li> Protect XmRenderTableGetRendition() against NULL tags.
<li> Implement XmRenditionRetrieve().
<li> Fix an #ifdef problem causing render tables not to get initialised correctly.
<li> Remove _XmProcessTraversal as it is not needed.
<li> XmProcessTraversal() didn't pass the result of one of its calls. Fix that.
<li> Implement a patch for the build system that was overlooked for too long.
<li> Add XmVersionString() : a function to report the library's version as
     a string.
<li> Calculate font parameters for the whole of the fontset passed in XmText's FontInit().
     This fixes the observation that XmText showed stuff in the wrong place when using
     a fontset, as in Xbae's multibyte example.
<li> Fixes by Tobias Oed for XmText and widget size and font size handling.
<li> Add configuration file for <A HREF="http://www.autopackage.org">autopackage</A>.
     Not working yet in my environment though.
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.94.0 (December  3, 2004 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Fix memory leaks.
<li> Fix a problem in DebugUtil.c - it didn't compile with --enable-production.
<li> Controversial hack to accept accelerators even if NumLock and/or CapsLock is on.
<li> Fix to _XmGetFocusData to get focus data from MenuShells,
     which are not derived from VendorShell.
<li> Allow popup menus to "stick" if button-up is within double-click-interval of button-down
     (to behave more like Motif).
<li> A button grab fix.
<li> Another fix that I must have never submitted diff for (don't ever let MemWidget
     get set to, for example, a seperator because we always assume it's a label of some kind).
<li> More scroll wheel support - this is in XmScrolledWindow which now automatically adds
     translations to its children for this to happen.
<li> Cleanup in some memory allocation code, hope to fix more leaking.
<li> Configure.in was trying to figure out whether it could write into
     the autoconf macro directory; that was wrong as Martin Simmons
     pointed out. Fixed this, also make sure to feed the directory info to the
     lesstif.spec file.
<li> Fixes by Dave Williss for the option menu resize problem that he reported,
     and for (bug #1060425) an option menu highlight problem.
<li> Apply the second batch of Xpm fixes for memory leaks - xorg-681-CAN-2004-0914.patch
<li> Fix build problem.
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.93.96 (September 26, 2004 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Changes to make the build system work again.
<li> <b><i>From now on, LessTif only builds as a Motif-2.1 clone.
     The 1.2 compatibility build has (finally!) been removed after
     several years of 2.1 being the default build.
     </i></b> Do note that this may produce incompatibilities between
     this version and earlier releases if you were still using the 1.2 mode.
<li> Compile a debugging function for printing stack traces only when the
     supporting functionality is available.
<li> Don't use /bin/false etc; that kind of stuff is sometimes on other
     places such as /usr/bin .
<li> A couple of XmList fixes.
<li> Fix XmForm's geometry_manager() to cope with XtGeometryAlmost situations better.
<li> Added scroll wheel support.
<li> Fixes by Dave Williss for some XmFrame bugs.
<li> Workaround/fix for pushbuttons not handling their resize when the application uses
  SetValues to set an acceleratorText.
<li> The recent Xpm security fixes.
<li> Fix for uninitialised memory problems.

</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.93.95b (August 18, 2004 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Changes to make the build system work again.
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.93.95 (August  6, 2004 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Cleanup of the configure.in to remove some dead code and add a couple of comments.
<li> <b>Remove support for building a Motif-1.2 compatible version</b>.
     This only keeps generating problems for users, there's no added value.
<li> Also remove support for building a Motif-2.0 compatible version.
<li> Work on the clipboard code to make it work with xclipboard.
     Nedit and DDD users were reporting problems.
<li> Bugfix for drag and drop code.
<li> Get XmText to use the character width estimations described in the documentation.
<li> A fix to the CascadeButton widget and gadget code for 64-bit systems.
     Lesson learned : using the wrong type can create havoc even on dummy variables.
<li> XmClipboardBeginCopy() wasn't present in a 2.1 build. Fix that for compatibility reasons.
<li> Changes to autoconf macros to conform to autoconf 2.59's new requirements.
<li> Remove reference to <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>, they're no longer needed.
<li> Prevent a crash in Form when no widget is passed but XmATTACH_WIDGET is
     specified.
<li> Fix from Herbert Xu to fix a long outstanding bug with nedit modality.
     (See patch #936869.)
<li> Fixes by Dave Williss to get XmString to cope with Unicode
     in a limited way.
<li> Fixes by Dave Williss for the (Microsoft) Windows platform.
     One of the consequences is that the macro XMLIBEXPORT is used in many places.
     On the Windows platform, we configure the build so this means something to the compiler;
     on others it is blank.
<li> Fix by Dave Williss for XmForm to cope with XtGeometryAlmost.
<li> Fixes for geometry in XmRowColumn and XmScrolledWindow.
<li> Fixes for memory problems detected by Purify.
<li> Fix for an off by one error in XmList.
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.93.94 (November 27, 2003 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Yet another attempt to fix nedit's grab behaviour problems.
     (that are caused by lesstif).
<li> Rename a private function to avoid namespace pollution.
<li> Don't bother with terror.hungry.com in the make_release script.
<li> Implement Add Mode in XmText. This means that the selection doesn't
     disappear when moving the cursor around. You can toggle this by
     using Shift-F8.
<li> Fix some memory leaks.
<li> Fix for an invalid XmStringFree in XmList.
<li> Fix an X server hang when clicking in an option menu.
<li> Fix an extended selection problem in XmList.
<li> Fix for gadget colour problems, and bugfixes on the fix (it was wrong for a while).
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.93.46 (July 18, 2003 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Hopefully this fixes both of the nedit grab issues.
<li> List hightlight problem fix.
<li> Fixes for XmText(Field)GetSubstring bugs.
<li> Fix for a 2.0 build problem.
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.93.44 (June 30, 2003 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Fix for a memory leak in TextF.c
<li> Quick fix to try to implement overstrike behaviour in XmText.
<li> Fix for bug #736415 (XmText widget still buggy) - the code that determined
        a string length claimed to take tabs into account but didn't correctly
        do so.
<li> Bug #721016.
        In an OptionMenu, while holding down the mouse left
        button, dragging it onto the label gadget (label of the
        OptionMenu) and then releasing it causes the X Server
        to hang.
<li> Fix for bug #721010 "text is displayed in the reverse order in TextWidget"
        Selecting the text by double clicking on it and then deleting it with a
        backspace in a TextWidget causes the text typed afterwards to be displayed
        in the reverse order.
        
        This was happening because the cursor position was going
        negative inside _XmTextDelete function and due to this,
        the newly typed character was getting added on the left
        side of existing text rather than on the right side until the
        cursor position becomes positive.
<li> Patch provided by Herbert Xu : this patch fixes comparison bugs on
        platforms with unsigned char as the default.
<li> Patch by Peter Breitenlohner - see bug #711442.
<li> Fix the problem reported by DIG in textf/test12. (when I click on ``enter text'' button,
then selection of ``textf'' field (filled with 23.5) become "dirty" -- this field get filled up
with apparently random characters and get highlighted. )

</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.93.40 (February  6, 2003 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Start work to extend LessTif to work with the Xft library
	(see http://fontconfig.org) so we can work with anti-
	aliased fonts.
	Hopefully we can feed some of this work into OpenMotif.
<li> Include configuration/build support for the Xft library.
<li> Fix a bug in _XmStringDraw that crept in when the support
     for renditions and rendertables was built.
     It showed in OpenDX as not correctly centering text in
     a label widget.
<li> Fix grab problem with nedit (bug #566315 "NEdit - new window ignores all input")
     by going back to the fix as it was in Vendor.c version 1.83.
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.93.36 (August  6, 2002 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Fix XmText, XmTextField problems with highlighting, that were
     introduced by adding visual appearance to indicate that the
     widget is insensitive.
<li> Fix a random unselect colour in ToggleBG.
<li> Fix XmText strangeness when editing. Some text would appear in
     strange places, especially after deleting some lines and then
     adding stuff again. (Reported about OpenDX, also bug #215484.)
<li> Fix XmText selection bugs.
<li> Fix XmForm geometry bugs.
<li> Clean up the pixmap cache when a XmScreen gets closed.
<li> Fix XmText wrapping bug.
<li> Add <Xm/IconH.h> file.
<li> Fix for XmMainWindow not keeping track of destroyed children.
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.93.34 (May 19, 2002 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> XmContainer fixes (to make XmOUTLINE mode,
	which displays a tree of children widgets, work well enough to get Xplore
	and meditres happy).
<li> XmIconGadget fixes.
<li> Initial implementation of the CareParentVisual Trait.
<li> Begin work on XmSPATIAL layout in XmCONTAINER.
     Implementation seems to work with Xplore now.
<li> Drop the 2.0 version of ManagerP.h, there was no obvious need for it.
<li> Change the memory allocation of XmFontList and XmFontListEntry.
     Our implementation treated them as (almost) the same, they've now
     been converted into something that looks like XmRenderTable and
     XmRendition.
     This is also true for the 1.2 version of LessTif, even though that doesn't
     offer the XmRend* API's. We can do this because the structure of
     XmFontList and XmFontListEntry is internal to LessTif so this is
     really none of your business.
<li> Additionally, as described in
     <a href="http://www.motifdeveloper.com/tips/tip2.html">Anthony's tip 2</a>
     implement shared, reference counted, <i>XmFontListEntry</i>s.
<li> Start implementing XmRenderTable, XmRendition, XmTabList.
     Look at test/Xm-2.0/rendition for a multi-coloured list demo.
<li> Bugfixes for FileSB, RadioBox
<li> Make mwm to read the appropriate configuration files
<li> Initial implementation of _XmMapKeyEvents() as described
     in <A HREF="http://www.motifdeveloper.com/tips/tip15.html">Anthony's tip 15</A>
<li> Quite a few bugfixes
<li> Support for XmNunselectColor.
<li> Modal dialog behaviour improvements.
<li> XmText and XmTextField now show a visual indication if they're insensitive.
<li> XmText and XmTextField now use shared GC's (XtAllocateGC instead of XCreateGC).
<li> Move some test directories from test/Xm into test/extra,
     because they're really different beasts than the other stuff in test/Xm.
<li> Fix the build for automake 1.6.* compatibility.
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.93.18 (December 20, 2001 mai)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Various small fixes
<li> Enhancements to Container widget
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.93.14 (October 24, 2001 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Nothing to report yet. <!-- Replace this line -->
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.93.14 (October 24, 2001 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Work in progress on XmContainer.
<li> Build system fix for 1.2 version.
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.93.12 (September 26, 2001 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> XmSpinBox fixes.
<li> XmSimpleSpinBox : simplistic implementation.
     This should become a complete widget, probably copied from XmSpinBox.
<li> More small 2.x compatibility fixes (add missing calls as stubs at least)
<li> XmObjectAtPoint() had wrong signature and was dealing with Gadgets only
<li> Try to use automake 1.5.x, autoconf 2.5x, libtool 1.4.x
<li> Use XmStringCreateLocalized() to convert widget name into a label string
     if we're in the Motif 2.* version; this makes newlines work.
     Undocumented feature of Motif 2.*, documented in SF bug #456132.
<li> Install string to tearoffmodel converter by default if Motif 2.*,
     another undocumented feature of Motif 2.*.
<li> Rename a couple of documentation files (e.g. NOTES to ReleaseNotes.html).
<li> Fixes in IconGadget and Container.
<li> Fix installation process. Now builds/installs out of the
     box on all platforms supported by libtool
<li> Drop redundant files from distributions (source tarballs)
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.93.0 (August  7, 2001 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Note that this release is still based on older versions of
     the auto* tools (libtool 1.3.5, automake 1.4-p4, autoconf 2.13)
     because of trouble that we have to reliably get all the recent
     versions to work across all the platforms currently used by the
     core team.
     <I>
     Some platforms - e.g. NetBSD 1.5.* - seem to suffer from this.
     Our only advice currently is to obtain recent versions of
     libtool and autoconf, and to use the CVSMake script to build
     LessTif based on that.
     </I>
     We hope we can resolve these issues in the near future.
<li> Bugfixes and further development of DtPrintSetupBox.
<li> Support for XmTextFieldSetHighlight()
<li> Bugfixes and an additional resource for XmSpinBox.
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.92.98 (July 28, 2001 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li>
Enhancements for the docs (FAQ, Installation Docs, manpages)
<li>
Update our list of platforms where LessTif can be build on
<li>
mwm fixes/enhancements from Andrei Rezvov &lt;rezvov@niisi.msk.ru&gt;
<li>
Drop inter-library dependencies (any libtool 1.4 related features)
<li>
Add checks whether to link against -lXp -lXext when using 2.1 Motif libraries
(e.g. clients, in our test/ tree)
<li>
Fix dmalloc debugging support (within configure script)
<li>
Add some files missing from our test/ tree in the tarballs
<li>
Smaller configuration and Makefile issues (portability fixes)
<li>
Remove support for configuring and building Xlt and Xbae from
within the LessTif distribution; they will be treated as separate
packages from now on.
We've been wasting entirely too much time on complexities caused by
this lately. No more, I hope.
<li>
Various fixes for (potential) memory corruption
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.92.32 (June  2, 2001 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Small code fixes to help building on some systems
<li> Use new libtool version 1.4 and automake 1.4-p1
<li> Install more machine-indepedent files in $(prefix)
<li> Continued work on Xbae, version 4.9.0 was not working as well as expected.
<li> Added the old XbaeMatrix home page in lib/Xbae/doc.
<li> Added scripts/sf_cron.sh which is run periodically from cron on a shell
     server on sourceforge.net to update the web page from CVS.
     The result is that now http://lesstif.sourceforge.net and
     http:://www.lesstif.org are identical.
<li> Removed all the support in Xbae for Motif versions lower than 1.2.
<li> Move the manual pages's installation to $(exec_prefix)/man,
     this is also where they're moved in the RPM installation.
     This makes the lesstif.spec file more transparent.
<li> Release Xbae 4.9.0
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.92.26 (March 26, 2001 mai)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li>
Fixes for small problem with List widget.
More work required on this ...
<li>
Fixes for some recently introduced bugs within configure.
Now link libXm* against -lm if ANSI C math stuff is hidden there
<li>
Small Scale widget fix (rounding problem)
<li>
Added two stubs for missing 2.x interfaces.
On stub level we should be very close to a complete 2.1 set now
<li>
Fixes by Kazuyuki Funada, mostly for i18n.
<li>
Fix and add more (incomplete) man pages to the install target
<li>
Link our shared libraries against the necessary system libraries
(e.g. libXt, libX11) to hardcode the dependencies
<li>
Rename libDt to libDtPrint, this appears to be what it's called.
Remove the print_screen field from struct DtPrintSetupData,
the Motif 2.1 manual pages (e.g. about XmPrintSetup)
are misleading about libDtPrint.
<li>
Add -lMrm to the Xlt tests, this is necessary as SciPlot now
uses Mrm.
<li>
Make build option --with-dmalloc to work again properly
<li>
Make more debugging functions available in a PRODUCTION build
(no performance penalty)
<li>
Debugging output (DEBUG_FILE env var) is now always explicitly unbuffered
and can now be sent to "stdin"/"stderr" as well
<li>
The environment variable controlling which files send debugging output
has been renamed to DEBUG_SOURCES and now accepts a blocking entries
<li>
Debugging output can now be en-/disabled upon runtime.
(env vars DEBUG_TOGGLE, DEBUG_SIGNAL)
<li>
Xbae : removed the #ifdefs controlling the variable height code and the 24 bit code.
From now on these are always compiled.
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.92.6 (Dezember 21, 2000 mai)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed a couple of configuration issues
(dependencies on GNUMake; incomplete check for gethostname();
drop non-standard str(n)casecmp() if not necessary; check for a
HTML to Text converter; ...)
<li>
Fixed CVSMake scripts (checks for M4, HTML to Txt converter)
<li>
Increase portability of our scripts/man2html utility
</ul>
<hr size=5>
<h2>Release 0.92.0 (Dezember 14, 2000 mai)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li>
Build/Install Uil libs and Headers (and tests) by default.
<li>
Fixed some FontList interfaces to conform to the docs.
Might fix memory leaks as well.
<li>
Got the build system to accept CFLAGS, etc. within the main tree
and the test tree.
<li>
Since 0.91.8 according configure.in scripts have been cleaned up,
improved (drop useless checks; added helpful ones) and they've been
enriched by some additional comments.
Earlier the XTHREADS test had been fixed.
<li>
Ongoing work to use ANSI C89 as much as possible. Drop
alternatives being used (e.g. bcopy() and friends)
<li>
The Motif 2.x Xme() funcs should now all exist in stubs at least;
some had already been "implemented" earlier.
<li>
Makefiles tweaked so "make dist" produces a distribution that works.
<li>
Added contributed code by Frank Mair for having bold columns in XbaeMatrix.
<li>
Build support for a Motif 2.1 compatible tree.
This will soon replace the 2.0 tree.
<li>
Work in progres for creating XmPrint API. (2.1 functionality)
<li>
Add lib/Dt directory for the CDE Desktop functionality.
</ul>
<hr size=5>

<h2>Release 0.91.6 (August 30, 2000 danny)</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Fixed a bunch of memory leaks.
<li> Bring the 2.0 version of LessTif in line with how Motif uses
     Xpm - that is: use the normal XPM API.
     This gets Xbae/examples/draw to compile in a 2.0 environment too.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.90.1</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li>We had a major blow up in the configuration of this release
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.90.0</h2>
<!-- Ok to change after this line -->
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> XbaeMatrix : work in progress for making rows resizable.
     This is already in place for columns, it is one of the requirements
     for being able to handle different fonts.
     <b>This may break binary compatibility with previous releases.</b>
<li> Various XmText bugfixes.
<li> Add Xm/MenuT.h trait include file, required for Xmt 2.1.3.
<li> XbaeMatrix : two bugfixes related to use of global variables (auch).
<li> CascadeButtons : if we set the sub-menu on a menubar there is no need to refresh.
<li> All over : remove reference to timers we've nuked with XtRemoveTimeOut().
<li> XmList (XmEXTENDED_SELECT) - the selected_item_count was always coming back as 1
<li> ImageCache : add None symbolic name for transparency.
<li> XmTextFieldSetSelection - do not allow the start or end position to be
     greater than the current length.
<li> Make Labels handle bitmaps in the version 2 case only
<li> XmRowColumn : Give the focus to the root when we don't know were else to put it
<li> SelectionBox has a class method called list_callback.
     In our FileSB class initialization this field was missing.
     This was causing FileSB sub-classing problems.
<li> Do not activate an accelerator belonging to an un-managed widget. (DDD)
<li> Mnemonics were being installed and un-installed based on a different set of rules.
<li> Make label handle pixmaps with a depth of 1.
<li> Xbae : consistent use of ANSI C prototypes.
<li> Several bugfixes to RPM configuration file (lesstif.spec).
<li> Work in progress for making Xbae widgets threadsafe.
<li> XmListReplaceItemsPosUnselected doesn't replace last item due to the
     test being performed as if position were 0 based rather than 1 based.
<li> DragBS : don't tell bcopy to copy a negative length.
<li> Various fixes for compiler warnings.
<li> DragBS : _XmWriteDragBuffer also seems to have difficulties - it doesn't
     work if the 'size' is bigger than 1000, because someone had the bright idea of
     hardcoding 1000 in as the maximum possible size.
<li> Convert web pages to using JPEG instead of GIF.
<li> Add Builder Xcessory example files for Xbae widgets.
     With these you should be able to import the Xbae widgets onto the BX palette.
<li> Print a couple of warnings if someone calls Mrm thinking it might actually
     do something.
<li> Clean up website text consistency.
<li> Fix XmListYToPos().
<li> Get rid of <varargs.h>
<li> Our sample system.mwmrc wasn't correct.
<li> Manager.c : virtual key accelerator handler.
<li> lesstif.spec : make sure the include files for Xbae, Xlt make it in.
<li> lesstif.spec : split the "devel" RPM into two - the "devel" RPM keeps
     the development stuff (include files etc), the new "static" RPM
     contains the static libraries.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.89.9</h2>
<!-- Ok to change after this line -->
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Implement ScrollOneLineDown and ScrollOneLineUp. This is very usefull
once you get one of those wheely type mouses.
<li> XmNmenuHistory now working for RadioBoxes.
<li> Patches to get mnemonics working in nedit.
<li> General code cleanup (getting rid of unused "global" symbols)
<li> XmListGetSelectedPosition fixes
<li> Lots of geometry fixes
<li>XmTextSetHighlight fixes
<li>XmList fixes
<li>Form widget significantly reworked (breaks binary compatibility)
<li>openDX translations now working
<li> Add Linas Vesptas's fixes to make XbaeMatrix cope well with
     cell widgets; these are widgets that stay inside one of the
     matrix's cells.
     <A HREF="http://www.gnucash.org">GnuCash</A> uses this extensively,
     <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/oleo/oleo.html">Oleo</A> will use it too.
<li> Add XbaeMatrixGetCellWidget() for API completeness.
<li> Patch by Jens Krinke for having multiple highlightings in XmText.
<li> Convert Xbae FAQ into HTML
<li> Xbae used to have #if CELL_WIDGET, they were now removed to make sure
     cell widget functionality is always compiled in.
<li> Updates to the lesstif.spec (file to create RPMs).
<li> Add <a href="http://www.ics.com">BuilderXcessory</a> configuration files
     that allow you to use the Xbae widgets in BX.
<li> Add XltCreateSciPlot(), this was a missing API, it was "needed" for the
     BX integration.

<h2>Release 0.88.9</h2>
<!-- Ok to change after this line -->
<hr size=5>
This is a quick summary of some of the more important things that
have changed since the last release. For a more detailed view, see
the ChangeLog file.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Use libtool 1.3.3 which should get us more platform support.
     Check out the libtool information files for specifics.
<li> Configuration now more correctly handles libtool and whether to
     build and install shared and static libraries.
<li> Remove some files from the distribution. They belong in
     libtool or the auto-tools, we get them from there.
<li> doc/INSTALL.html changed to more accurately describe what
     to do when getting a CVS copy of LessTif.
     This really has to do with the removed files mentioned above.
<li> (2.0) Notebook widget layout significantly enhanced.
<li> Fixed small bug in i18n to get nedit to work.
     You need to compile nedit with -DUSE_XMIM though.
<li> Add #include <LTconfig.h> everywhere.
     Note that in the mwm/ directory this is handled in mwm.h .
<li> Upgrade our XPM (lib/Xm/LTXpm.c) to 3.4j, and change the
     prefix to _LtXpm instead of _XmXpm to indicate this is not
     a Motif thingy.
     Notebook uses this. (So did mwm already, and the image cache,
     and we register a resource converter - depending on build
     options.)
<li> Numerous tweaks to the visuals of labels/buttons, to bring them
     closer to the goal. This required some changes to the menu code.
     In some cases it has been made much simpler.
<li> Fixed the problem with nedit and accelerators. nedit installs and
     removes accelerators _alot_. The mask were were using to install and
     remove event handlers did not match, therefore the handler was not
     removed, but all the data the handler used was freed. Needless to say
     strange things happened after this.
<li> Lots of improvements for XmText.
<li> Many changes to ScrolledWindow and MainWindow to get them closer to
     the ultimate goal.
<li> Configuration verifies symbolic link presence with -r instead of
     non-portably testing with -L, -l, or -h.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.88.1</h2>
<!-- Ok to change after this line -->
<hr size=5>
<ul>

<li> Build system changes.  Should now be more error free, on wider
variety of platforms.  <b> Linux version now produces libXm.so.1.0.2
instead of libXm.so.1.2</b> You may need to run "/sbin/ldconfig" as root
after installing this version.

<li> This release introduces a major overhaul to the menu system.
Keyboard traversal of menus works much better, and overall menu behavior
is improved.

<li> Many more of the automated tests pass, implying that the geometry of
more apps should be closer to OSF/Motif behavior.

<li> ToggleB[G] and CascadeB[G] cleanup by Jamie. (Well, *that* covers a
lot of ground.

<li> Shadow.c: Added BC functions _XmDrawSquareButton and _XmDrawDiamondButton.

<li>ResConvert.c: Add ResConvert/define for XmONE_OF_MANY_ROUND and
XmONE_OF_MANY_DIAMOND. 

<li> Improve form layout handling: This is the new layout algorithm,
brought about by my nagging suspicions, and the proof from form/test50.
FormAllPaths used to calculate the size of the enclosing box of a clump of
widgets.  It didn't pay any attention to where on the form that box is
placed. The new code pays attention. If a clump of widgets needs a height
of 100 and is placed at 50, it now knows that a form height of 150 is
needed. All the same tests pass, including the dreaded test13, but be on
the lookout for something that used to work and doesn't now.

<li> Added hack to prevent nedit core dumps (see Manager.c 1.62 CVS log)

<li> Plugged memory leaks in List.c, Vendor.c, Protocols.c,
XmStringCompare(), and significantly FileSB.  LessTif apps should not
"grow" in memory requirements nearly as much with this release.

<li> MainW geometry handling overhauled.

<li> Optimized Text a bit.  Should be *much* faster now in adding text to
large buffers in ScrolledText windows.

<li> And, as always, many other bugs fixed.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.88.0</h2>
<!-- Ok to change after this line -->
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Fixed layout of RowColumn for children with borderWidght !=0.
<li> FileSelectionSearch update.
<li> Fix for incorrect information in XmNchildren for menus with tear-off
controls.
<li> Prevent a few segfaults in menu traversal.
<li> The build system overhaul should be working properly now.  RPMs are
still 1.2 only, but the tarball binary distribution should now have both
1.2 and 2.0 versions of the library.
<li> Prevent segfault in nedit 5.0.2.
<li> Tear-off-menu updates (and more to come...)
<li> ScrollBar fixes in ScrolledW/DrawingArea
</ul>


<h2>Release 0.87.9</h2>
<!-- Ok to change after this line -->
<hr size=5>
<H3> Major change to build structure.  Now builds 1.2 and 2.0 versions by
default.</h3>
<ul>
<li> The 2.0 tree release breaks binary compatibility with all releases
     prior to 0.87.1 of the lesstif libraries because of a change to the
     NotebookP.h.
<li> Build system changes require the following tools and versions:
<ul>
<li> Autoconf version 2.13 
<li> ltmain.sh (GNU libtool) 1.2 
<li> automake (GNU automake) 1.4 
</ul>
<li> The build now creates (by default) both 1.2 and 2.0 compatible
     versions of the libraries.
     They are installed in $(prefix)/LessTif/Motif1.2 and
     $(prefix)/LessTif/Motif2.0 
     but the appropriate links are created in $(prefix)/lib and
     $(prefix)/include.
     Changing an installation that simulates 1.2 into one that acts
     like 2.0 is a matter of changing a couple of symbolic links.
<li> INSTALL no longer exists as a separate source in CVS,
     it is generated from doc/INSTALL.html by running lynx on it.

     Those who get a copy of LessTif from CVS will get a warning from
     automake saying that INSTALL is missing.

     This warning is harmless, the LessTif build process will generate
     the INSTALL file if it finds lynx.
<li> The doc/INSTALL.html is updated to reflect the new build options.
</ul>
<h3>Other code changes</h3>
<ul>
<li> Fixed nasty bulletin board placement bug.
<li> Fixed bugs in Scrollbar: now allows 0x0 widget in realize
<li> List scrollbar names changed to VertScrollbar and HorScrollBar
<li> Improvements to scrolling in Text Widgets,
<li> Text cut-n-paste improvements.
<li> Form layout improvements.
<li> Menu fixes, including improved traversal code.
<li> 64-bit compatibility fixes 
<li> Lots of fixes for grok.
<li> And much more!
</ul>


<h2>Release 0.87.1</h2>
<!-- Ok to change after this line -->
<hr size=5>
<ul>

<li> This version will <i>probably</i> break binary compatibility with
0.87.0, although I don't see anything specific at the moment.  Don't count
on binary compatibility, though.

<li> This version introduces a significant overhaul of lesstif's internal
geometry handling thanks mainly to the hard work of Jamie Gritton and Rick
Scott in the general area of visual appearance (geometry, layout, and
color handling).  These won't be detailed here (cvs log if you're
interested).  Overall, though, we're getting much closer to exact
compliance with Motif's geometry handling.  Among the many other changes are:

<br>   Reorganization of drawing functions, step 1:
<br>   There are no more _Xm*_1_2_ or Xme*_2_0_ functions.
<br>   What used to be in ShadowI.c as _Xm*_1_2_ are now in Shadow.c as _Xm*.
<br>   What used to be Xme*_2_0_ in DrawI.c is now Xme*.
<br>   The Xme* that used to call _Xm*_1_2_ from Draw.c now call _Xm*.
<br>   The _Xm* that used to call Xme* from Obso1_2.c are replaced by Shadow.c.
<br>   Some cleanup of formatting and argument names in DrawP.h (both) and Draw.c.
<br>

<li> TextF got some updates, and should work better now
<li> Fixed "nervousness" in DrawnB's; better labelString handling in
DrawnB's 
<li> reset TopPosition in XmListDeleteAllItems
<li> NULL protection in List.c
<li> Better handling of cascade (and other) menus; should work better with
xmgrace
<li> Added XmSHADOW_ETCHED_IN_DASH and _OUT_DASH from (1.2.5) to Separator.c
<li> Internals of Scrollbar changed significantly, should work better now
(including processingDirection )
<li> indicatorOn converter patch
<li> implented NEXT_KEY in Protocols.c (huh?)
<li> Arrows from 1.2 and 2.0 now share more code
<li> FileSB now copies FS_DirMask if it changes in set_values
<li> changes in Form handling to work better with Ted (a text editor)
<li> Added Rob McMullen's SciPlot widget to libXlt.
<li> Added Rob McMullen's ListTree widget to libXlt.
<li> Add configure.in stuff for conditionally building XDND support.
<li> Configuration changed so EditRes is no longer triggered by
     whether or not you ask a production build.
     From now on, you ask EditRes support by --with-editres if you
     are performing a production build. A non-production build defaults
     to supporting EditRes.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.87.0</h2>
<!-- Ok to change after this line -->
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Geometry fixes for FileSB, Frame, Form, ScrollBar and others
<li> Labels no longer croak when given a None pixmap
<li> MenuShell:  Call popup/popdown callbacks.
<li> RowColumns no longer croak when all their children are unmanaged
<li> MenuShells created by applications instead of the library now have 
the correct grabs and hooks installed  
<li> Implemented XmTextRemove, changed XmTextCut and XmTextSetString
</ul>



<h2>Release 0.86.9</h2>
<!-- Ok to change after this line -->
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Overall, we're relying more on our test suite now to tell us about
problems, and we're beginning to take steps towards automating running the
tests. 
<li> Various B/W and resolution independence fixes from Jamie Gritton.
<li> Fixed unreleased mouse grab in menushellpopdown routines
<li> Absolute <i>tons</i> of geometry fixes from Rick Scott
<li> Broke test programs out of main tree
<li> Fixed a double callback in bulletinboards
<li> Fixed Drag 'n Drop so that you could turn it off with resources
<li> Fixed quite a few memory leaks
<li> Added a couple of convenience functions such as _XmObjectLock(w) and
     _XmObjectUnlock(w) which you can use to lock the application context
     of that widget in a multi-threaded environment.
     These functions are defined such that they can safely be used even
     when compiling against X11r5.
     According to a reply to my query on comp.windows.x (by David Lewis),
     essentially all convenience functions should be protected by these.
     General explanation (very little though) is in the Xt documentation,
     secion 7.12.
     <B>Can anyone clarify ?</B>
<li> Toggle Button (widget and gadget) now have a third state, XmINDETERMINATE,
     in a 2.0 compliant LessTif.
<li> The 2.0 tree release breaks binary compatibility with all releases
     prior to 0.86.5 of the lesstif libraries because of a change to the
     VendorSEP.h.
     All programs which use dynamically linked M*tif 2.0 compatible
     lesstif libraries will have to be re-compiled to use the new libraries.  
     If you don't wish to do this,
     see the --enable-back-compat option of configure.
<li> Cloned ArrowBP.h, ArrowBGP.h, ToggleBGP.h, DrawingAP.h, ManagerP.h
     and PrimitiveP.h for the 2.0 tree and added new 2.0 resources.
     This also breaks binary compatibility for the 2.0 tree.
<li> Added new file Direction.c to the 2.0 tree.
     This contains stubs for the XmDirection family of routines.
<li> Add a couple of files and links, and perform some cleanup
     so Lessdox doesn't contain so many broken HTML links.
     Note that this adds documentation to LessTif about a number of
     Xt functions and widgets. The documentation only refers to the
     Xt docs though.
<li> Build system changes require the following tools and versions:
<ul>
<li> Autoconf version 2.12 
<li> ltmain.sh (GNU libtool) 1.2 
<li> automake (GNU automake) 1.3 
</ul>
<li> Fixed values of enum in CutPaste.h.
     This breaks binary compatibility for both 1.2 and 2.0.
</ul>
<h2>Release 0.86.5</h2>
<!-- Ok to change after this line -->
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li>Button ArmAndActivate action re-work.
<li>BulletinBoard default button processing.
<li>Initial BulletinBoard geometry.
<li>DialogShell children positioning.
<li>MenuBar sizing in MainWindow's, they now wrap to multiple rows if they
    are resized too narrow.
<li>Numerous improvements to Text and TextField.
<li>Improved color handling.
<li>Plugged numerous memory leaks, especially in XmStrings and labels.
</ul>
<h2>Release 0.86</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Implemented XmStringCompare w/o calling XmStringByteCompare, since
	that wasn't sufficient.
<li> Mozilla now has sorted directory and file lists!
<li> Implemented undocumented feature xmUseVersion.
<li> Inserted patch by Gary Aviv to implement XmPanedWindow better.
<li> An autoconf macro, AC_FIND_MOTIF, was added to the distribution,
     in scripts/autoconf/.
     This macro is based on a similar one by Andreas Zeller (ICE_FIND_MOTIF),
     but it presents other variables with which to build your Makefiles.
<li> Some small changes for 2.0 builds
<li> Traversal fix for ScrolledW.  This from Karsten Jenson.
<li> Some geometry tweaks for BulletinBoard
<li> XmTextField.c:XmTextFieldInsert() - We were not setting the CursorPos
   	before the insert so the text was not getting to the correct pos.
   	This was showing in ml's save file dialog.  It's been this way for
   	a long time, I just got tired of it.
<li> Various patches from Stephen Gallimore on XmStrings, double line
	separators, internal widget names in FileSB, _XmGetColors and
	_XmAccessColorData.
<li> Now use integer math for Lists in list.c
</ul>
<h2>Release 0.85.3</h2>
<hr size=5>
<b>NOTE:</b> This release breaks binary compatibility with all releases
	prior to 0.85.3 of the lesstif libraries because of a change to the
	indicatorType resource of ToggleButtons.  All programs which use
	dynamically linked lesstif libraries will have to be re-compiled to use
	the new libraries.  If you don't wish to do this, see the
	--enable-back-compat option of configure.
<ul>
<li> Extensive changes to FileSB.  Focus handling is now in line with the
	Motif spec
<li> Handles cascade buttons w/o children correctly
<li> Removed several spurious shadows and geometry problems
<li> Changed menu wrapping code in RowColumn again (does this work right now?)
<li> FileSB and Selection Box dialogs in general now have correct behavior
	of their buttons.
<li> and more!
</ul>




<h2>Release 0.85.3</h2>
<b>NOTE:</b> This release breaks binary compatibility with all releases
prior to 0.85.3 of the lesstif libraries because of a change to the
indicatorType resource of ToggleButtons.  All programs which use
dynamically linked lesstif libraries will have to be re-compiled to use
the new libraries.  If you don't wish to do this, see the
--enable-back-compat option of configure.

<b>Another Note:</b> Some of the items in this list may in fact regard
changes after 0.85.3 because of a breakdown in the release script
process.  I hope those problems have been fixed and we're back on track
now.  In any case, this list is meant to be informative rather than
normative.  The detailed information is available from the cvs logs anyway.
<ul>
<li> Add the flag --enable-back-compat to provide other project maintainers
     with a way to build to the original Lesstif ABI.
<li> Scrollbar patches to make Mozilla happier
<li> preliminary Drag & Drop support
<li> Cascade button now works properly with no submenu
<li> Fixes to form for some obscure cases
<li> Cleaned up list geometry
<li> Extensive changes to FileSB based on test results
<li> New release number format
<li> Small fix to MessageBox
<li> Preliminary Drag and Drop support from Waider
<li> Scrolled Window patches from Karsten Jenson
<li> Geometry fixes to the List Widget.
<li> Add check for <ctype.h> in configure.in to be able to safely
     include it in lib/Xm/misc.c.
     Requested by Alexander Mai, probably for OS/2.
<li> Add XmONE_OF_MANY_ROUND which is required in Motif 2.0.
     wxftp doesn't compile without it.
     This does not break --enable-back-compat.
<li> (OSF/Motif 2.0 compatibility)
     Frame.c : add support for XmNframeChildType which does the
     same thing as the obsolete XmNchildType.
     This requires a bit of hacking.
</ul>
<h2>Release 0.85.1</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> configure.in : use newer libtool 1.2 way of specifying default
     (i.e. don't generate static library)
<li> configure.in : changed the values for detecting man2html from 0,1
     to no,yes.
     This may break your build if you've kept a config.cache
     from a previous release.
     Either remove config.cache, or change the value that reflects
     presence of man2html from 0 to no (or from 1 to yes).
<li> Reorganized the drawing functions in Xm/Shadow.c and Xm-2.0/Draw.c
     so changes to the 1.2 drawing functions will make it into the
     2.0 branch.
<li> Added function ComputeArrowSize to Xm-2.0/ComboBox.c.  This
     routine should now calculate the arrow size properly.
<li>
</ul>

<li> TextField clipboard ops now programmed with XmClipboard API.
     This was half done in 0.84 (and disabled through #ifdef), now
     it's enabled.
<li> Copied the experience and also used the XmClipboard API
     in XmText.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.84</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Several fixes for <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</A>,
     which now works rather well with LessTif.
<li> Significant changes to the way XmFileSelectionBox treated
     its filesystem access functions.
     Getting it to work with Mozilla proved to be a good way of
     figuring out how they're supposed to work.
<li> Merged Traits stuff from lib/Xm-2.0/Text.c and TextF.c back into
     lib/Xm/Text.c and TextF.c .
     Keeping two versions in sync where the only difference between them
     are a couple of traits definitions (~ 2% of the source) is silly.
<li> There are a couple of man pages being installed, both as "man" source
     and as HTML. The man to HTML conversion happens with a slightly
     modified version of Debian's man2html. The slight modification is
     just so I can tell it to filter (as in a traditional Unix filter),
     not just to serve underneath a web server.
<li> Upgraded to libtool-1.2.
     This only involves two files: ltconfig and ltmain.sh .
<li> Put one documentation file per widget in doc/lessdox/widgets
     as a start for replacing the long defunct Lessdox.
     The conversion from man to HTML (as indicated above) is built into
     the nightly script, and a copy is made to the web pages, so the
     HTML for the manual pages is online on the Internet at
     <A HREF="http://www.lesstif.org/Lessdox">
     http://www.lesstif.org/Lessdox/</A>.
     The man to HTML stuff should also still be built into the release
     scripts so releases will contain this stuff as well.
<li> Finally found out why PageUp and PageDown wouldn't work as expected
     in nedit.
     Turns out to have to do with the Virtual Keys and a cache in Xt.
     (I think.)
     If anybody knows of a better way to solve this, please tell us.
<li> Several fixes to XmText.
<li> Small fix so popup menus stay visible when clicking MB3 (usually)
     instead of just holding the button down.
<li> Implemented clipboard operations for XmTextField.
     Cleanup of the code, to use XmClipboard* API, is in progress.
</ul>
<h2>Release 0.83</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> New configuration based on automake, autoconf, libtool.
     All of these are GNU tools available from the usual sites,
     such as
     <A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu">ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu"</A>
     but you don't need to have any of these for using or building
     LessTif unless you want to alter LessTif itself (adding directories,
     files to treat by configure, ...).
<li> The new configuration won't change anything for you; if you want to
     build LessTif you still only need to run
     <PRE>
	configure <I>add your options here</I>
	make
     </PRE>
<li> If however you change anything to a makefile.am, or to configure.in,
     or if you're running Cygwin32 or OS/2 (once these things get ported)
     you'll have to run the following sequence :
     <PRE>
	autoheader	<I>creates include/LTconfig.h.in</I>
	automake -i	<I>converts Makefile.am into Makefile.in</I>
	autoconf	<I>converts Makefile.in into Makefile</I>
	configure	<I>add your options here</I>
	make
     </PRE>
<li> In the M*tif 2.0 compatibility area, a couple of things happened. 
     The XmeDrawArrow routine was improved.  It now acts as the M*tif 2.0 
     version of the function.  All XmeDraw* routines have been moved from Xme.c
     to Draw.c.  Removed the link Shadows.c and added a file Obso1_2.c for 1.2 
     routines deemed obsolete in 2.0.  Added new tests for the XmeDrawArrow 
     routine.  Also, the size calculation routines of the XmComboBox widget 
     were improved.
<li> The scripts/mmf will rebuild the Makefile in the directory in which
     your run the script. It's much faster than rebuilding all the Makefiles
     by running configure on the whole distribution.
     Be careful when using it after modifying configure.in though; you will
     end up with an inconsistent set of Makefiles.
<li> There is now a XmPanedWindowWidget in the 2.0 directory as well;
     it is nearly the same as the 1.2 version : the only difference is
     an additional resource (XmNorientation).
     SashAction (interactively moving the panes) isn't 100% foolproof yet.
     <A HREF="http://sunsite.auc.dk/xinvest/">Xinvest</A> uses this.
<li> Notebook (also in 2.0, see below) is beginning to do sensible things.
     It uses some of the traits in sensible ways, and can be used to display
     pages and page through them using both a SpinBox and tabs.
<li> For those of you who are using a binary distribution of LessTif: there
     are currently no 2.0 widgets in those; our binary distributions are 1.2
     based for now.
     You can build a 2.0 version from source by running
     <PRE>
	configure --enable-build-20	<I>more options</I>
	make
     </PRE>
<li> Placement of the XmComboBox scrolled list is now correct.  However, 
     the initial size calculation of the scrolled list is incorrect.  Added
     a new internal routine called XmeShellSmartPlacement (see file
     PopupUtil.c).  This routine attempts to keep the shell completely 
     visible before XmePopup* is called.  Also, added two XmePopup* routines 
     to wrap the XtPopup family of routines.
<li> More 2.0 stuff...  Added header file DrawP.h to the include/Motif-2.0/Xm 
     directory.  Removed Xme* function declarations from DrawP.h in the 
     include/Motif-1.2/Xm directory.  These routines do not exist in the 
     1.2 tree and would result in unresolved symbol errors if used.
<li> You can build from other directories than LessTif's root directory.
     This is what I did on my system (from LessTif's root) :
     <PRE>
	mkdir DEBUG
	cd DEBUG
	../configure  --prefix=/usr/lesstif20g --enable-debug --enable-build-20 --enable-nonstandard-conversions
	make
	cd ..
	mkdir PRODUCTION
	cd PRODUCTION
	../configure  --prefix=/usr/lesstif20 --disable-debug --enable-build-20 --enable-nonstandard-conversions --enable-production
	make
     </PRE>
<li> Added a couple of Makefiles to also install doc/www.lesstif.org
     when doing a "make install". Consequence is that binary distributions
     will also contain the information from the web site. (At least a
     snapshot of it taken at release time.)
<li> Added a couple of manual pages donated by
     <A HREF="mailto:jdassen@debian.org">Ray Dassen</A>
     and put them in doc/lessdox/clients.
<li> Added Makefiles so the manpages above are installed in
     PREFIX/LessTif/doc/man and PREFIX/LessTif/doc/html .
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.82</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Build support for the Cygnus Win32 environment.
     May not be complete yet.
<li> Finally implemented a default functions for TopShadowPixmap
	and HighlightPixmap in Primitive and Manager.
<li> 2.0 compatible widgets : GrabShell (internal widget), SpinBox
	should work reasonably.
<li> 2.0 : Traits also implemented (which is not a big deal), but
	no work has been done on adding traits to widgets, except
	where needed for SpinBox.
<li> Peter Pilgrim gave us the basics for XmPartOffsets.
	Thanks, Peter.
<li> Build : add run-time library path options (-R on Solaris, NetBSD;
	-Wl,-rpath on OSF/1).
<li> Added the web pages for the LessTif site to CVS.
     Now you can see in lesstif-*/doc/www.lesstif.org what you normally
     get from <A HREF="http://www.lesstif.org">http://www.lesstif.org</A>
<li> Add string to widget converter.
	Apparently Motif 1.2 has this but previous versions didn't.
<li> Various fixes to XmText; one of which was the I-beam cursor overwriting
	initially displayed text.
<li> Build support for SlackWare and RedHat.
<li> Work on popup menus has led to a revamping of the menu system in general.
	Popup menus should show better behavior now, although keyboard focus
	isn't 100% yet.  Grabbing in general should be handled a little better
	now (I'm interested if people get messages about "XtWarning: Asked to
	remove widget not on the grab list").  Mnemonics and accelerators
	should behave better.  Option menus should also behave better,
	in general.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.81</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li> Added stuff-to-string converters to the Editres functions built into
     LessTif. Also fixed the bug that prevented it from passing getting
     values.
     You'll also need a small patch on your editres to use this. (See below.)
     After that, you'll be able to <b>query</b> widget values with editres.

    All of this code was donated by Peter Derr
    <A HREF="mailto:pderr@zk3.dec.com">&lt;pderr@zk3.dec.com&gt;</A>.
<li> Many more geometry fixes.
<li> The code has been struck by the mad indenter.  Most core library
    code will now have a consistent look.
<li> Various fixes for xmcd - see KNOWN_BUGS.
<li> In the Motif 2.0 compatibility area, a couple of things happened.
Traits were implemented, a XmSpinBox widget has an initial implementation,
and a couple of widgets (XmTextField, VendorShell) were copied from the 1.2
directory to cooperate better with XmSpinBox. (Read: they support traits).
<li> Build fixes for a 2.0 compatible library.
</ul>


<h2>Release 0.80 alpha</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li>Work on selecting text, copy/paste, ... in XmText has begun.
    It's somewhat functional : primary selections seem to work,
    not all key combinations for the keyboard traversal business may
    be supported yet though.
    (Please send E-mail to lesstif@hungry.com if anything's missing.)
    Nothing has been done for secondary selections yet.
<li>Support for SetValues and GetValues on resources in the input and
    output objects of XmText is implemented now.
    Not all resources are treated yet though (especially SetValues),
    but at least changing the fontList seems to work.
    Mxgdb demonstrates that GetValues also works.
<li>Lots and lots of work on geometry.
<li>Added a Makefile target "install-list" everywhere, which prints a
    list of files that the "install" target will install.
<li>Based on this, created stuff in scripts/FreeBSD to create a binary
    package that can be installed with pkg_add(8) easily.
    Waiting for someone to do similar stuff for Linux.
<li>Drag and Drop is "primitive", at best.  Do not be surprised if Btn2Click
    on labels and subclasses cause you problems.
</ul>


<h2>Release 0.79</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li>Fix build problems in 0.78, new Form code.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.78</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
<li>New directory structure to allow for CDE and 2.0 widgets.
<li>For testing purposes, the Interleaf ComboBox widget is added to
    the Xm-CDE directory.
    If someone cares to replace or enhance it, please do so.
    I'm no legal expert, but enforcing LGPL license on LessTif if
    part of it is covered by the license Interleaf has put in,
    might be contradictory. (Note that the Interleaf license is more liberal
    than LGPL.)
<li>A version of ComboBox with "dt" changed into "xm" is also put into
    the Xm-2.0 directory for testing purposes.
    Similar comments apply : we may want to replace this sucker.
<li>New version of configure.cmd (for OS/2) from Michael Holzapfel.
<li>Layout details (remember the "Pixel Police" ?) are finally understood
    and are getting into place in ScrolledWindow.
<li> Drag and Drop is somewhat working at this point.  We don't do
    PREREGISTER (because nobody has documented it), so it gets emulated
    by the DYNAMIC protocol.  Cross application dragging doesn't work yet.
<li>Improvements to the menu system. Option menus look a bit better,
    popup menus have improved and grab balancing is close to being OK.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.78</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>  Started rework on XmMainWindow following similar work
	on XmScrolledWindow. Compile with -DNEW_MAINW to enable.
  <li>  Added stuff that'll allow applications to be compiled using
	imake. LessTif itself continues to be configured using a
	"configure" script generated with GNU Autoconf.
  <li>  Added DEBUG_FILE variable to DebugUtil.c so you can direct
        debug output to a file easily. It's faster than scrolling
        in an xterm window. Also apps like ML hang when you send
	stuff to stderr because they catch stderr and throw whatever
	they find in a Motif (err LessTif) XmText widget.
	Chicken and egg problem.
	Try using it with setenv DEBUG_FILE /tmp/lesstif.%p
  <li>  Improvements to the menuing system.
  <li>  DragDrop has been started.  Drag cursors are about the only thing
	that work, though.
  <li>  Major changes to the source tree layout are upcoming in the next
	release.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.76</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>  The clipboard has mostly been implemented, but it does still have
	a few problems.
  <li>  The implementation of XmScrolledWindow has been completely reworked.
	Results should be visible in
	<A HREF="http://www.in-berlin.de/User/bitrot">plan</A>
	and xdiff.
  <li>  There is a new #define, NONSTANDARD_EXTENSIONS.  This is not enabled
        by default.  If enabled, it will allow lesstif to transparently
        convert a string to a pixmap for resource converters (which many
        people feel Motif should have done a long time ago).  Thanks to
        Peter Williams for this patch.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.75</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Public release.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.71</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>XmRegion code is getting there. -- Chris
  <li>New List widget.  Thanks Blake and Jon!
  <li>The clients/uil directory is being reworked completely. You'll notice
     that all the C++ stuff is gone. Thanks Geoff.
  <li>Configure was extended so you can choose not to compile the testXm
     and/or testMrm directory trees. Use configure -help to find out more.
     Configure also recovers if testXm or testMrm are not there.  -- Danny
  <li>Default for the new options --with-testXm and --with-testMrm
     changed to *No* meaning tests only get compiled if you want them to.
     -- Danny
  <li>Traversal/Focus/Navigation has been completely reworked; They should
     function much better these days.  This change was fairly massive, so some
     things are surely broken.  Feedback requested. -- Mitch
  <li>XmFontList and XmString have new implementations; they should be more
     faithful to their Motif equivalents.
  <li>LessTif should also work on OS/2 now. Thanks Michael Holzapfel and
	Christoph Jaeschke.
  <li>Rewrite of mwm.  It's much better behaved now, with most appearance
     resources and a good bit of the behavior resources supported.  Transients,
     when they go away, now give the focus back to their parents (which might
     help with the locking focus problem sometimes seen in fvwm). SYSTEM_MODAL
     dialog support is more or less in, but cascading system modals will not be
     well behaved.  The parser is much more friendly, and shouldn't have any
     problems with multiple menus.  Multiscreen support is in (although you
     can't specify resources for each screen, but global resources work fine).
     Most of the Motif oddities with window properties are supported, including
     run-time update of the properties, application defined window menus,
     f.send_msg, etc.  Dialogs for quitting, restarting, and toggling custom
     behavior are in (with some drawing problems, but they do work).  As always,
     feedback on what works and what doesn't is desired.  See the files
     clients/mwm/README and clients/mwm/Mwm for details. -- Mitch
  <li>Pulldown menus work a bit better. -- Peter
  <li>Many geometry management fixes (esp. in RowColumn). -- Danny
  <li>The debugSources resource was removed;
     only the environment variable is left in the code.
     <PRE>setenv DEBUGSOURCES Command.c:SelectionBox.c </PRE>
     should do the trick.
  <li> Dialog modality is partially implemented.  Thanks Harald.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.50</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Option menus are now in (somewhat). -- Chris
  <li>Menu Gadget support is almost up to the
      level of Widgets.  Use it with caution,
      as it may lock your server.  Mosaic 2.7b2
      menu items are selectable now. -- Chris
  <li>Debugging info from LessTif can be enabled
      by setting environment variable DEBUGSOURCES
      or the equivalent resource to a list of
      the source files that you want to see info
      from. test2 -xrm "*debugSources: Command.c:SelectionBox.c"
	-- Danny
  <li>Quick and Dirty implementation of internationalisation
	(i18n) for TextField. Works on XFree86 3.1.2 on
	FreeBSD, and on HPUX with X11R5.  -- Danny
  <li>First cut at FastSubclassing.  Starting rework of
	GadgetCache objects to be more in line with Motif.
	SyntheticResources and Resolution Independence are
	in, but a bit shaky (maybe).  Many more import/export
	procs need to be written.  Both Chris and I are working
	on the BaseClass stuff -- quite a lot to do there.  More
	mwm improvements (should be more stable on more platforms
	now).  Need to work on "shields up" for modality and
	multiscreen support for it.  If you experience core dumps
	with mwm, check and see if you compiled the library -- on
	some platforms, modifying the library a running executable
	uses can cause this (Solaris, Linux), as they think it's
	pure code, and don't swap it.  The alternative is to link
	mwm statically.  Oh, and I got rid of those pesky warnings
	in LTEditres.c. -- Mitch
  <li>GeoUtils have (somewhat) been implemented.  They still need
	work, though. -- Mitch
  <li>Pulldown menu grabbing is in the works. It kinda works for
	Cascade button WIDGETS, not at all for gadgets yet.
	In the gadget case, it's #ifdef-fed out. In the widget
	case it is not.
	If your menus appear to freeze, pressing Escape usually
	helps. If it does not, please send me detailed info.
	-- Danny (u27113@kb.be)
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.36</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Initial version of Mwm is in.  It's a bit rough, so don't expect to
      much.
  <li>Menu dragging is sort of working better.  This only applies for widget,
      so menus that use gadgets (such as those in Mosaic) will not work.  This
      will change quickly, so be patient.
  <li>Initial TearOffButton stuff
  <li>Fixed bug in configure.in for NetBSD/FreeBSD using GNU make
  <li>Added support for linux-aout shared libaries.  Thanks JanJaap!
  <li>New Gadget Cache and ExtObj stuff.
  <li>Better (more in line) geometry management in the RowColumn
      widget, the PanedWindow, and the Frame.
  <li>Lots o changes in Form, MessageBox, BulletinBoard.
  <li>Rob McMullen's TextField widget has been folded into lesstif.
      Thanks Rob!
  <li>RepTypes are actually working now. How come nobody told me :)?
  <li>Drag and Drop is beginning to take shape.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.33</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Harald Albrecht has contributed implementations of the VirtKeys stuff,
      XmDisplay widget, and the first "official" Lesstif client - <code>xmbind</code>
  <li>The configuration management stuff should be working much better
      and more portably across all the supported architectures.
      For those of you with Free/Net BSD, you can now use BSD make to 
      build lesstif for your machine.  Check out the <code>INSTALL</code>
      file for more information on configuration.
  <li>Gadgets and Manager widgets now communicate in a much more
      Motif-like fashion (with the _XmDispatchGadgetInput function).
      Gadgets specify an event mask to tell their parent what events
      they're interested in.  Also, more gadget events are handled,
      like the enter/leave events.
  <li>The beginning of the default button handling in dialogs is in --
      in the <code>ParentProcess</code> stuff.
  <li>The list widget should be a little less problematic now.
  <li>Included John Richardson's patch for XmLabelWidget/Gadget.  Now
      label behavior is much better.
  <li>_XmDrawArrow (Mitch's baby :) is behaving itself better lately.
  <li>We're starting to go after some of the more underlying things,
      like the GeoUtils and Traversal stuff.  Don't expect miracles
      though.
  <li>Fixed some problems with the Fontlist stuff returning NULL.
  <li>Lot's more stuff that I've forgotten.  If I missed something you
      sent in, please resend it (after seeing if it wasn't fixed another
      way :)
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.3</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>The list widget is currently undergoing a reworking.  Please don't
      expect much, but I'm working on it.
  <li>ScrolledWindows are working better. Thanks
      Mitch.
  <li>Applied countless million patches :)  Some didn't make it in.  I'll try
      to get to those soon.
  <li><code>memcpy</code> and <code>memmove</code> are not
      used anymore.  We now include <code>Xfuncs.h</code> and
      use <code>bcopy</code>.  If your system has a better
      way of doing it, it's probably set in there.
  <li>Configuration system should be working better.
  <li><code>makedepend</code> is now used for generating
      dependencies.  If you don't have it, comment out the lines
      in libXm and libMrm that use it.  Lesstif will eventually
      be packaged with makedepend so that it'll build it if it
      can't find yours.
  <li>Scales and Scrollbars are basically done (we think)
      barring minor cosmetic changes. Thanks Mitch and Peter.
  <li>Default buttons are now drawn differently in
      bulletin boards (and subclasses).  They're not
      <em>correct</em>, but they're drawn differently.
  <li>Code for handling unspecified width/heights has been
      changed to check the request widget's width and height,
      and now it checks for 0, instead of XmUNSPECIFIED.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.2</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Updates for MessageBox/BulletinBoard
  <li>Fixed primitive widgets unhighlighting themselves.
  <li>Better scale/scrollbar widgets -- patches from Mitch.
  <li>Added _XmClearBorders.  This function should be used to erase shadows
      and highlights.  Primitives now call it to erase their highlights when
      their parent is not a manager.
  <li>Added default button shadows to PushButtonWidgets
  <li>Added shared library support for HPUX 9, IRIX, Linux (ELF only), 
      FreeBSD, NetBSD, DEC OSF/1, SunOS 4, Solaris 2, AIX3, DG/UX 5.  
      I want your input on the current scheme.  Does everybody like it?
      Thanks to Xiaokun Zhu for his help.
  <li>Fixed problems with missing \n\'s in Transltns.c
  <li>Fixed x_includes and x_libraries not being set on IRIX after 
      configuration
  <li>Moved to include'ing a template makefile for the tests.  Made their
      Makefiles much smaller.
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.1</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Changed lesstif to use autoconf instead of imake
       This will hopefully make it easier to configure stuff
       for different platforms so that the globbing stuff
       works correctly.  Along with this change, however, is
       the new job of getting shared libraries built for each
       platform.  If you have an idea on how we should go about
       doing this, please let me (<a href="mailto:toshok@hungry.com">toshok@hungry.com</a>)
       know.
  <li>The glob stuff has changed to be in the same directory
       as the other libXm stuff, and the function names have
       changed to _Lesstif_glob, etc.  The filenames have also changed,
       to LTglob{.c,.h} and LTfnmatch{.c,.h}
  <li>From this release on, libXmu need not be linked in with
       lesstif.  This is because we now include the _XEditresCheckMessages
       function, calling it _LesstifEditresCheckMessages.  The relevant
       file is LTEditresCom.c.
  <li>This release contains lots of fixes to the form widget from Danny et al.,
       and a new AtomManager from Harald Albrecht, which is doubtlessly more
       efficient than the previous incarnation. Excellent work Harald!
  <li>Vendor shell now responsed to the XmNmwmDecorations and XmNmwmFunctions
       resources.  If you have mwm running, you can now specify programmatically
       the decorations and functions that toplevel shells have.  Neato.
  <li>From this release on, I'm now going to start using numeric release numbers,
       (0.1, 0.2, etc.) so that when shared libraries start working, we can
       have a direct correspondence between the distribution and the shared libraries.
  <li>The Label widget's insensitive GC is now properly created.
  <li>CascadeButtonGadgets now draw themselves in the proper color, and are properly
       highlighted by XmCascadeButtonHighlight.
  <li>The menu system doesn't grab you server anymore, so you can run programs that
       have menus without fear of locking you server.  Xt grabs are used, however, which
       is the way things should work (in part.  Server grabs are necessary, but I'll get
       to that once the toolkit grabs are functioning properly.)
  <li>Most of the correct Motif translations have been integrated into lesstif.  You'll probably 
       see lots of warning messages about lesstif not being able to find an action.  These
       will go away soon.
  <li>I hear we're going to be written up again in next month's Linux Journal.
       Great work guys!
</ul>

<h2>Release Sep12-1524</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Most widgets now have their correct motif translations.
      Not all the specified actions are present, but those
      will come along.
  <li>Pixmap top and bottom shadows are supported now, both
      for manager and primitive widgets.
  <li>The primitive widget in general is almost complete.  One gaping lack
      of functionality is the resolution independence offered by synthetic
      resources.
  <li>Better <code>set_values</code> methods for some widgets.
      They now don't do silly things, like checking the request
      against new...
  <li>More complete interaction between mwm and XmVendorShell, 
      including client decorations and functions (see the testXm/vendor 
      testcases)
  <li>Better <code>XmTranslateKey</code> (actually, it's still rather broken..)
  <li>Buttons now draw themselves better in menus (i.e., no highlight rectangles) -- <i>I think</i>...
  <li>Blinking cursors for XmTextField (<i>yay!</i>)
  <li>Updates and fixes to many, many things...
  <li>I'm holding off on putting in the autoconf stuff until I get it functioning
      properly, or at least better...
</ul>

<h2>Release Sep01-1407</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>PushButton now correctly catches the ButtonUp event
      when the pointer is moved out and back into the
      widget, as do the other button widgets, withough the
      in_window field.  Gadgets also handle this correctly
      now, through their parent's manager translations.
  <li>PushButtons now fill in their interior when fillOnArm
      is set to true.
  <li>ArrowButton gadgets now draw themselves correctly,
      not at (0,0).
  <li>Many more fixes to widget code to use the #define'd 
      access macros.
  <li>Pixmaps are drawn more correctly in label subclasses
      -- i.e., they're centered properly (well, one or two pixels
      off, but who's counting) when the widget is smaller than 
      the pixmap.
  <li>Form and MessageBox updates from Danny
  <li>Scale updates from Mitch
  <li>Fixed <b><i>NASTY</i></b> bug with some default procedures.
      The offending functions used XtDisplay() instead of XtDisplayOfObject() 
      -- they're supposed to work with both widgets and gadgets -- and these would
      cause SIGSEGV's on my box, except they would happen in between the call to 
      <code>class_part_initialize</code> and <code>initialize</code>.  Ugh..
      <i>Actually, I've fixed various places where XtDisplay() is used for
      gadgets, like in the SeparatorGadget and ToggleButtonGadget expose 
      routines...</i>
  <li>We're now using the translations supplied in the mot.trans file 
      (testXm/misc/mot.trans), generated by Mitch Miers, for most widgets.  I'll add
      the rest for the next release.  <i>Please nobody send me them as a patch,
      I'll enter them myself.</i>
  <li>Fixed bug in SeparatorG that was using the XmUNSPECIFIED for the direction that
      its oriented in (e.g., width = XmUNSPECIFIED when orientation = XmHORIZONTAL).
  <li>Gadget seem to be working with MessageBoxes now... Dialogs!  Yay!
  <li>The menu system is in need of some overhaul and much pencil and paper work.  The
      next release may not affect too much more than that (well, I won't be working on 
      much more than the menu system and traversal)
  <li>I have not yet had a chance to try out lesstif on DEC's public alpha machine.
      There were some problems with out of scope function prototypes causing memory
      alignment problems.  These are not fixed (to my knowledge) in this release.  I'll
      look into it for the next release.
  <li>I've cooked together a <code>configure</code> scheme for lesstif, which I'll be 
      patching into the source tree something this next week.  It will handle most of
      the system dependent things much better than the imake system we're using now.
  <li><em> Wow... A lot has changed :)</em>
</ul>





<h2>Release Aug23-2257</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Converted the primitive widgets to use the "correct" 
      preprocessor symbols (e.g., Prim_ShadowThickness(w), XtWidth(w), etc.)
      Actually, I got most of the way through this... Too much work for
      one night.  I'll finish up the rest for the next release.
  <li>Pervasive change from using <code>strdup</code>() to <code>XtNewString</code>(),
      and <code>Xt</code>{<code>Malloc,Calloc,Free,Realloc</code>}, instead
      of their C library counterparts.
  <li>Re-engineered the event handling of the PushButton widget.
      This removed the funky and unnecessary "in_window" instance
      variable.  The only problem appears when the select button is
      pressed inside the pushbutton, and then the pointer is moved
      outside the window and then back in -- the ButtonRelease event
      is not passed to the widget.  Moving the pointer outside the
      window and releasing, as well as clicking inside the window work,
      though.  This should be an easy, boneheaded fix, somewhere in
      the Arm action (I think).
  <li>Preliminary ImageCache and Pixmap cache, which (as far as I 
      can tell) works like Motif's.  The label pixmap code now uses 
      XCopyArea again, so you can get into problems with pixmaps of 
      different depths than the widget's window.  This behavior exists 
      in Motif as well, so it's not a Lesstif bug.  
  <li>Atom Manager now does client side caching of atoms.
  <li>New testcases for Xmos (contributed by Mitch Miers) and 
      for the ImageCache routines.  Hey, on my Indy, testXm/imagecache/test1
      looks <i>exactly</i> the same under Motif and lesstif.  There
      still some problems with traversal (like, it isn't there) and
      redrawing on expose events, but initially it looks <i>identical</i> :)
  <li>A new resource converter for XmFontList's is in, so you can specify
      fontlists in resource files.  <b>Note</b>:  I've only tried this for
      single entry fontlists, without tags.  More testing is necessary here..
</ul>

<h2>Release Aug14-1709</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Sheesh.  I was in a hurry this morning to get the new release out
      and got bit by RCS again.  I've modified my distribution script so
      that it now checks everything in before tarring it up.
  <li>Also, I've included the latest Shadow.c patch from Jeremy Allison.
      Thanks Jeremy!
</ul>

<h2>Release Aug14-1051</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>First off, I've moved back to school for the semester -- starts in two
      weeks.  Much of the work I did this summer on a linux box, displaying
      to an HP X terminal doesn't work now -- going from an HP735 to an Indy :(
      It seems to be focused mainly in the RowColumn widget.  I'll fix this
      for the next release, but for now, it seems to be pretty broken.
  <li>Included all the patches (I hope) sent to me since the last release,
      including those from the Pixel Police (tm) :)
  <li>TextFields and Text widgets should be working better thanks to Danny,
      Mitch, myself and others.  For one thing, nasty unterminated strings
      should not be present anymore.  Also, the handling of the initial size
      of text fields has been fixed.
  <li>The "input" resource on VendorShells is fixed so that LessTif programs
      will by default accept the keyboard focus.  Now you can actually type :)
  <li>Traversal is beginning to work.  For now, the behavior is limitted to
      that of EXCLUSIVE tab groups (meaning that the keys move you around in
      the order of child insertion, not by screen layout.  This should be
      easy to add, but it'll be dependant on the manager widget type (I think).
      For an example, check out testXm/textf/test2.c.  Run the program, hit
      the down arrow in the window, and hit return.  This should activate the
      XmNactivateCallback for the pushbutton widget. -- <i>(Actually, this
      seems to be another piece of code that broke with the move... Your
      mileage may vary.)</i>
  <li>ToggleButtons seem to be very nearly complete -- nice work guys!
</ul>

<h2>Release Aug07-1618</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>This release is nothing more than the Aug07-1158 release with
      all the gadget header files included.  I forgot to check them
      in to RCS, so they weren't included in the last distribution. -- <i>Chris</i>
</ul>

<h2>Release Aug07-1158</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Selection box, Message box, and File Selection Box
      updates from Danny Backx and Mitch Miers
  <li>The rest of the gadgets are in, thanks to Mitch Miers.
  <li>Event passing from XmManager to XmGadget is in now.
      The individual gadgets do not all take advantage of it,
      though.  Take a look at the initialize() and input_dispatch
      methods of the pushbuttongadget for an example how it 
      might work.
  <li>Integrated the scrollbar fixes contributed by
      Peter van Helden.
  <li>The virtual key bindings are working now.  To get
      keyboard input for some window managers (like fvwm,
      mwm seems to be ok), just set the resource "*.input"
      to True.  For example:  'test1 -xrm "*.input: True"'
      will work.  There is an example .motifbind file in 
      this distribution in "example.motifbind".  Just move
      that to ~/.motifbind, and those bindings should work,
      given that you're not running mwm, or you haven't 
      set the defaultVirtualBindings resource. 
  <li>The beginnings of keyboard traversal within manager
      widgets.  Actually, the code properly calls 
      XmProcessTraversal in most cases, but this function
      only prints out the argument at the moment.
  <li>Beginnings of synthetic resources for resolution
      independence.  Check out the syn_resources in Label.c
      for an example.
  <li>The whole menu/cascadebutton scheme should be a little
      more bug-free now.  
  <li>New XmCreateSimple* routines contributed by Mitch Miers.
  <li>The RowColumn layout for XmWORK_AREA (at least) is 
      broken for the moment.  I'll get to this next week.
  <li>I've taken the liberty of once again reorganizing the 
      test trees.  Now, each directory has in it files named
      "test1", "test2", etc.  When contributing test cases,
      which are desparately needed right now, focus on a 
      particular feature of the widget, and write a concise 
      test of that feature.
  <li>Hopefully I haven't missed anything.  Enjoy this new
      release -- The <i>LessTif</i> developers.
</ul>

<h2>Release Jul16-2340</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Many, many updates from Danny Backx (who seems to be the only one of
      us with much time this summer :)
  <li>Made ArrowButton descendant of Primitive, instead of Label.
  <li>Compilation should work now on SunOS 5.4 (no testing done though).
      I've built LessTif on a sparc 5 I've got access to at work, without
      a hitch.
  <li>Scale widget is in (<i>Finally</i>).  Actually, this should have been
      in for some time now, except I lost Paul's email that contained it.
      Thanks Paul.
  <li>FYI - LessTif was featured in the August issue of <i>Unix Review</i>
      Guess some people actually like the idea of a free Motif (nah... can't
      be :)
  <li><b>Administrativia</b> - Releases will now be made weekly, either
      sometime Sunday night or early Monday morning (depending on how much
      is going on at the time.)  I'll try to follow this religiously, but
      I may slip up every now and then (I'll have a really good excuse, 
      though.)
</ul>

<h2>Release Jul09-2314</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Too much to really speak of... sorry for the delay in the release.  I did not
      (and still don't) have reliable access to an X display for testing purposes.  This
      will change in the following week, but testing for this release is extremely 
      important.  Please email all bug reports to toshok@cs.uidaho.edu.  Thanks.
</ul>

<h2>Release May25-0249</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li><b>New</b> <code>_XmOS</code> functions, and stubs for the 
      internal <code>_XmString</code> functions, although there
      is no "internal" representation yet.
  <li>Updated instance variables for primitive widgets
  <li>Cleaned up the shadow drawing routines.
  <li>Making better use of ActionProcs.
  <li>Got Label Gadgets working finally -- others should move along soon.
  <li>Fixed default procs so they work with gadgets as well as widgets.
  <li>Menu stuff is working a little better now..
      still no traversal, but the MegaButton widget now works :)
  <li>Bernd Wiserner wins the award for most contributions in a single
      day.  He contributed a new suite of Imakefiles, which allow 
      shared libraries, as well as the XmUpdateDisplay function and
  <li>Fixed incorrect default size for separators.  Now menus look
      quite a bit better.
  <li>Did a lot of work with the label.  Now uses the TextRect 
      correctly (I hope).
  <li>Shouldn't see any more SIGSEGV's with pulldown menus.
  <li>The scrollbar, my bad habit, is now drawing better, but is
      still broken.
  <li>Fixed <b>many</b> problems.
  <li><i>Not all the bug reports for the last ROTD have been fixed
         yet, but I'm working on it :)</i>
</ul>
<h2>Release May10-0051</h2>
<hr size=5>
<ul>
  <li>Changed the test <code>Imakefile</code>s so that
      they don't build the Motif executables by default. 
  <li>Added Paul's shared library snippet to the Imakefiles
  <li>Restructure directories.  Hopefully, when the source
      starts getting really big, it'll be easier to find
      stuff this way.
  <li>Label and RowColumn <code>query_qeometry</code> method
      is working better.
  <li>Form widget is coming along (thanks Danny Backx!)
  <li>New version of the List widget (Thanks Jim!)
  <li>Basic <code>expose</code> method for TextFields.  When
      I get time, I'll probably hack up Matt's Text Widget to
      make the TextField, unless he beats me to it :)
</ul>

Release Apr25-0550
-----------------
<ul>
  <li><i>From Jim Hunt - </i> List Widget draws correctly, methods 95% written, actions started
  <li>Added most of the <code>XmColorProc</code> stuff.
  <li>New <code>XmAll.h</code> header <i> -- thanks Paul. </i>
  <li>New Text Widget, from Matt Crosby.
  <li>Moved functions around, and added new files, more in keeping
      with the OSF's source layout (from information gleened from
      <code>Xm/XmP.h</code>)
  <li>Public and Private Stubs for
    <ul>
        <li>The Pixmap stuff
        <li>Gadgets utilities
        <li>Traversal
        <li><code>XmCreateVaSimple</code>* calls
    </ul>
  <li>Big bug fix in <code>FontList.c</code> -- <code>XmFontListAppendEntry</code>
      thanks to all that reported it.
  <li>Currently XmScrolledWindowWidgets are broken.  They'll be fixed in the next
      ROTD (I hope :)
  <li>Most widget subclasses and programs compile now.  They are still in the
      hopelessly broken phase, but they <i>compile</i> :)
</ul>



Release Apr23-1256
-----------------
<ul>
  <li>Multiline and multifont labels now work.
  <li>Gadgets are there (well, they just <code>#include</code>
      the widget headers and <code>#define</code> some things).
  <li><a href="http://www.cs.uidaho.edu:8000/hungry/dist/phaser_chess_0.01.tar.gz">PhaserChess</a> 
      <b>actually</b> works now.  I actually made some
      small changes to the PhaserChess source to get it to work, but
      I started with an unadulterated tree a few days ago, and it 
      worked.
  <li>ScrolledWindows work now -- at least with the scrolling policy set to
      <code>XmAPPLICATION_DEFINED</code> and the scroll bar placement set to
      <code>XmBOTTOM_RIGHT</code>.
  <li>Harald Albrecht's ComboBox widget, which XWord makes use of, compiles now.
      It has problems running, since the list widget and text field widgets don't
      quite work yet, but this is a pretty big step, since it's a subclass of Motif 
      widgets.
  <li>XWord compiles now.  Don't take this news as more than it really is.  It 
      doesn't even come close to running.  But it will :)
</ul>

Release Apr20-0325
-----------------
<ul>
  <li>C++ safe header files (<code>extern "C" { .. }</code>).
  <li>Initial XmFormWidget work.  Should work if you only use XmATTACH_FORM or
      XmATTACH_WIDGET.  It uses an interative layout algorithm, so I
      assume it's much the same as OSF's (since I've seen errors about
      bailing out after 10000 iterations in some of my broken Motif code.) 
  <li>Labels are very nearly complete.  Paul Hoad contributed pixmap support for them,
      and I've just completed (I hope) the <code>set_values</code> method.  The actions
      need to be done, but that's about it.
  <li>Jim Hunt contributed a new version of the List widget.
  <li>VendorShells are actually working now, so the Virtual Binding and Traversal stuff 
      can now move forward, and some of the default resource procedures can be written
      now.
  <li>XmStrings (via <code>XmStringCreateLtoR</code> can now be used with multiple
      lines.
  <li>Menu fixes -- they're working better, but still not quite right (i.e. no pointer
      or keyboard grabs or traversal).
  <li>PhaserChess is actually playable now -- try it out.
</ul>
Release Apr10-1917
-----------------
<ul>
  <li>MenuBars are <i>very</i> close to working.  This includes the 
      CascadeButton stuff, MenuShell stuff, and the RowColumn stuff.
  <li>RowColumns in general work a lot better than before.  They actually make use
      of the RepType facilities now, so you can specify packing resources (for example)
      in resource files.
  <li>PhaserChess (another hungry product) compiles and links with LessTif
      now, but it still doesn't work properly yet -- there are problems in some
      of the <code>set_values</code> code and the Text widget isn't functioning
      properly yet.
  <li>Mosaic 2.5b4 very nearly compiles -- problems with gadgets not being there yet.
  <li>If you noticed from above, I've removed the line about not looking at
      the Motif headers.  This is do to the fact that, while trying to get Mosaic
      and moxftp to compile, I discovered that some people make frequent use of 
      private instance variables and undocumented Motif functions.  I've therefore
      changed most of the widgets (managers mostly) to use the Motif 1.2 naming 
      conventions.  The primitives will come along eventually.
