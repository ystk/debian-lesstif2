<TITLE>Geometry Management in LessTif</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>


<H1>Introduction</H1>


<p>
This document describes the way in which LessTif widgets handle
their geometry negotiations.
As geometry management is a subject that has much to do with Xt,
part of this document describes (what I understand of) the Xt
geometry model.
<p>
All feedback is, as always, welcomed.


<H1>Xt Geometry Management</H1>


<p>
The Xt geometry model is based on geometry negotiations.
This really means that every change that a widget wants to apply to
its geometry, must be approved by the widget's parent.
The resources in the widget that are part of this geometry are
<ul>
<li> x
<li> y
<li> width
<li> height
<li> border_width
</ul>
<p>
A widget can request a geometry change by using
XtMakeGeometryRequest or XtMakeResizeRequest.
In LessTif, we've wrappered XtMakeGeometryRequest
in _XmMakeGeometryRequest().  This is the preferred
method of geometry negotiation, as the result is
(or at least should be) binary -- Yes or No.

XtMakeResizeRequest only allows a widget to request
a different size (width/height),
whereas XtMakeGeometryRequest can be used
to alter all five resources mentioned above.
<p>
LessTif has a convenience function called _XmMakeGeometryRequest which
calls XtMakeGeometryRequest.

<H2>XtMakeGeometryRequest</H2>

<p>
The signature of XtMakeGeometryRequest is
<pre>
XtGeometryResult
XtMakeGeometryRequest(  Widget w,
			XtWidgetGeometry *desired,
			XtWidgetGeometry *allowed)
</pre>
<p>
It should be called from the widget which is passed as parameter 1.
The second parameter described the geometry that the widget would like
to have.
The last parameter returns the geometry that the widget got,
in some circumstances.
Finally, the result of the function is a value indicating
whether the request has been granted.
<p>
XtWidgetGeometry is a structure which holds the five fields indicated above,
and a bitset in which you can indicate which fields have been initialized.
In the return parameter, the bitset will also indicate how much information
is valid.
A common mistake is to assume
that the parent widget will always set width and height values,
and to just read those fields without looking at the flags.
<p>
The bitset field is called <b>request_mode</b>.
It can be set using an OR of zero or more of the macros
CWX, CWY, CWWidth, CWHeight, CWBorderWidth,
each of which has exactly one bit set.
A final bit XtCWQueryOnly is not currently used in LessTif.
When set, the call to XtMakeGeometryRequest will return a result without
changing anything to the widget.
<p>
The result of XtMakeGeometryRequest can have four values :
<ul>
<li>XtGeometryYes :Means that the request has been granted.
<li>XtGeometryDone :
The request has been granted, also it has been applied to the widget.
According to "X Window System Toolkit" by Asente &amp; Swick,
a widget set should choose a policy : either use YES in all widgets,
or use DONE.
In LessTif, we've chosen the YES approach.
<li>XtGeometryNo :
You can guess this by now : the request has not been granted.
Many manager widgets (subclasses of XmManager)
in LessTif will return this when they get a request to change the
X or Y (i.e. the position) of a child widget.
<li>XtGeometryAlmost :
This is a very useful but difficult return value.
It means that the request has not been <i>completely</i> granted,
and the <b>allowed</b> parameter returns a suggested geometry.
If the widget takes the suggestion and calls XtMakeGeometryRequest
with that same set of values, the parent widget <b>must</b>
allow this request.
That's the hard part.
</ul>

<H2>_XmMakeGeometryRequest</H2>

<pre>
XtGeometryResult
_XmMakeGeometryRequest(Widget w, XtWidgetGeometry *g)
</pre>
This function calls XtMakeGeometryRequest.
If the return value is XtGeometryAlmost, it'll call it a second time,
with the value just obtained.
Then it returns.
<p>
Another programming mistake (introduced by Asente &amp; Swick) :
given the Xt rule about XtGeometryAlmost,
you could program a loop in which you keep calling
XtMakeGeometryRequest until the value is different from XtGeometryAlmost.
The trouble is that this kind of a loop is only guaranteed to be
finite if the parent widget(s) are bug-free.
Need I say more?
<p>
_XmMakeGeometryRequest detects this problem and is verbose about it
(if you set DEBUGSOURCES to print information about GeoUtils.c).
It is known to happen with XmForm (i.e. XmForm currently doesn't always
grant a geometry that it just suggested).
<p>
If anybody wants a good exercise in understanding this document,
he or she is invited to find this bug.
Really.
I'll only start tracking it myself when I have no serious bugs to attend to.
A couple of beers can be had in Leuven, Belgium,
by the first person to fix this.

<H2>XtQueryGeometry</H2>

You can ask the preferred size of a widget.

<H1> Geometry and Widget Methods </H1>
The basic cycle involved is PreferredSize/XtMakeGeometryRequest/Layout.

<H2> For both primitives and composites: </H2>
<ul>
<li> <b>initialize()</b> -  Don't do anything if you're composite.
You don't know enough yet (and you probably don't have any
kids yet, unless the user created you with XtNchildren: if
the user does something like this, they're on their own).
If a primitive, you should know enough to do a basic layout.
<p>
<li> <b>set_values()</b> - If a value changed that should cause a
layout change, go ahead and recompute the PreferredSize.
Then, just set your width/height to the computed values:
the intrinisics will automatically see a change made and
call XtMakeGeometryRequest on your behalf, so (ordinarily)
<b>don't do a Layout</b>.
<p>
If the request is granted, the intrinsics will automatically
call your resize() method; that should be where the Layout
is done.
<p>
Rebuttal:  There may be times where this isn't true.  Some
resources may require a composite to re-Layout.  When doing
so, there are a few warnings that should be noted.
<ul>
  <li> If the user set a resource that triggered a size
	adjustment, the resize request may <b>not</b> be
	honored by the parent.  If it is not, and you
	re-Layout, then be aware that you may have layed
	out to a geometry that isn't honored.  This can
	cause (grossly understated) unexpected results.
	This case can (and does) happen in Label[G]; that's
	why there is a call to the resize() method in expose()
	-- to make sure the widget is displayed correctly.
	The same is true of CascadeB[G].
  <p>
  <li> A superclass may have polluted the widget dimensions,
	or a resource that changed in a superclass may have
	altered the widget dimensions to cause a request
	that may not be honored.  Laying out to this geometry
	may not be valid either.
</ul>
<p>
Unfortunately, the intrinsics do not notify a widget if the
resize request wasn't honored, so there's no way to do a
proper job of it unless the expose method calls Layout.
Needless to say, this is <b>not</b> good for performance.  One
optimization that can be made is due to the nature of
XtMakeGeometryRequest() (which will be discussed later);
if widget is not managed, or the parent isn't realized,
then we can be sure that the resize request WILL be
honored.  In this case, we can blithely call Layout and be
sure that the request will be honored.
<p>
<li> <b>resize()</b> - You can't do any geometry negotiation here.
You <b>must</b> take the size you currently have, and lay
yourself out to this geometry.  This method, in combination
with set_values(), show the requirements of the two basic
algorithms: one to compute the PreferredSize, and one to
Layout to a given size.
<p>
<li> <b>realize()</b> - For primitive subclasses, you probably want
to realize your window, and then Layout to it's geometry.
For managers, it doesn't hurt to go through the
PreferredSize/XtMakeGeometryRequest/Layout cycle again, as
things may have changed.
<p>
<li> <b>query_geometry()</b> - Call the PreferredSize routine, and
return the result if the request_mode is 0.  Otherwise,
return the usual rules of the request versus what you've
computed.
</ul>
<p>
<H2> For composites only: </H2>
<ul>
<li> <b>geometry_manager()</b> - The trickiest one.  The
PreferredSize routine should take two parameters, instigator
and instig_request, and use the values specified in
instig_request when treating the instigator.  There are two
additional rules that you should keep in mind:
geometry_manager() doesn't get called if the parent isn't
realized; it also doesn't get called if the child isn't
managed (in both cases, the request is automatically granted).
The method should then call _XmMakeGeometryRequest(); doing
this guarantees that either XtGeometryYes or XtGeometryNo is
returned -- you'll never see XtGeometryAlmost unless a
composite has a bug.  Finally the Layout function should be
called.  The Layout function should take two additional
parameters, the instigator and the instig_request.  What to
do next depends on the value that's going to be returned by
the geometry_manager():
<ul>
  <li> if the result of the Layout on the instigator is
	XtGeometryAlmost, then no change should be made to
	the instigator (<b>OR FOR THAT MATTER, TO ANY OTHER
	CHILDREN IN THE COMPOSITE</b>; this is an important point,
	and often alters the behavior of the layout method
	-- doing a Configure on a child when the geometry
	didn't change just wastes cycles).  Instead, the
	reply geometry should reflect what Layout computed
	for the instigator.  <b>IMPORTANT</b>: if the instigator
	calls back with the geometry that you computed, the
	geometry_manager MUST return XtGeometryYes.
  <p>
  <li> if the return is XtGeometryYes, the <u>child's rectangle
	should be modified to reflect the geometry</u>.  <b>THIS IS
	IMPORTANT</b>.  You must do this so that
	XtMakeGeometryRequest will reconfigure the requesting
	child's window.  This is different from XtGeometryDone
	in that XtGeometryDone implies that the window change
	was made by the parent, and we don't do that in LessTif.
	The GeoUtils and RowColumn do this now.
</ul>
<p>
In the layout function, if the child being manipulated is NOT
the instigator, then the child should be configured (normally
_XmConfigureObject()), if the return is XtGeometryYes.
<p>
<li> <b>change_managed()</b> -  You've got to go through the complete
cycle of PreferredSize/XtMakeGeometryRequest/Layout.  The
intrinsics don't help with any of this, so it's got to be
explicit.  Remember that you've no instigator here, so all
managed children should be configured if a size change took
place.
<p>
<b>insert_child()/delete_child()</b> - These methods are
called when a child is added to a manager widget, or when
a child is destroyed.  Their use is particularly important
in those manager widget which keep information about their
children in private data structures.
<p>
Note that these are <b>unchained</b> methods, which means
they are not automatically called for all the superclasses
of a manager widget.  XmRowColumn's insert_child needs to
call XmManager's insert_child, which in turn calls the one
in its superclass.
</ul>
<b>NB</b>:  If a composite, and you either a) have no children, or
b) have no managed children (BTW, _XmGeoCount_kids() will
return zero for case b), then you probably shouldn't bother
in either method to compute the preferred size or the
layout; mostly because you don't have anything to operate
on.  Instead you should probably return the current geometry
in query_geometry().

<H2> For constraints only </H2>
<ul>
<li> <b>constraint_initialize()</b> - Often, this method (if
present) will not cause any geometry changes, but does
offer an excellent time to capture information that will
affect geometry management in the future.  This includes
things like XmNpositionIndex (RowColumn), or XmNpaneMinimum/
XmNpaneMaximum (PanedW).
<p>
<li> <b>constraint_set_values()</b> - Tricky.  In this method, there
can be so many interactions that the mind boggles.  Quite
often, resources that are set here may have *serious*
implications for geometry management (like XmNpositionIndex),
but it is difficult to know when a change should cause a
Layout.  In general, <b>ALL OF THE WARNINGS FOR set_values()
APPLY</b>.
</ul>

<H1> The Geometry Management Helper Interfaces </H1>

There are two sets of two basic functions, that roughly have the signatures

For primitives:
<p>
<pre>
    <b>PreferredSize</b>( Widget <i>w</i> /* input */ );
    <b>Layout</b>( Widget <i>w</i> /* input with side effects */ );
</pre>
<p>
and for composites:
<p>
<pre>
     <b>PreferredSize</b>( Widget <i>w</i>, /* input */
                    Widget <i>instig</i>, /* input */
                    XtWidgetGeometry <i>*instig_request</i>, /* input */
                    XtWidgetGeometry <i>*preferred_geom</i> /* output */ );
     <b>Layout</b>( Widget <i>w</i>, /* input */
             Widget <i>instig</i>, /* input */
             XtWidgetGeometry <i>*instig_request</i>, /* input/output */
             XtWidgetGeometry <i>*preferred_geom</i> /* input */ );
</pre>
<p>

For primitives, an example of PreferredSize is XmCalcLabelDimensions(); the
equivalent Layout() would be the resize() method.  Regardless, you're Layout
function or PreferredSize function can be modified for different behavior
as appropriate to your class.

<H1>LessTif Geometry</H1>


We're discussing geometry of many of LessTif's manager widgets here.
One widget (and many of its subclasses) is not treated here,
though : XmBulletinBoard has functionality based on XmGeoMatrix
which allows you to build dialogs with it in a simple way.
This is all described in the document
<A HREF="GeoUtils.txt">$LESSTIF/doc/GeoUtils.txt,
`Fun and Pain with the GeoUtils'</A>.

<H2>Generic layout functions in complicated widgets <b>(deprecated)</b></H2>

Many of the LessTif manager widgets have one layout function
with a fairly large number of parameters.
This one layout function is built such that it can be 
called from all the geometry-related widget methods described above.
<p>
Here's an example of the signature of such a function :
<pre>
static void
_XmMainWindowLayout(Widget w,
		    Boolean ParentResize,
                    Widget child,
                    Boolean TestMode,
                    XtWidgetGeometry *cg,
                    XtWidgetGeometry *mwg)
</pre>
The parameters are used as follows :
<dl>
<dt>w</dt><dd>this is the manager widget</dd>
<dt>ParentResize</dt><dd>is a boolean which indicates whether the widget
is allowed to try to resize itself</dd>
<dt>child</dt><dd>is the instigator: it is the widget that requests geometry changes</dd>
<dt>TestMode</dt><dd>is another boolean;
if it is True, no changes are actually done to any widget resources</dd>
<dt>cg</dt><dd>is the geometry request for the child widget</dd>
<dt>mwg</dt><dd>optionally returns information about the main widget's size</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The structure of these functions is such that they can be called in a
number of circumstances.
A high level description of what they do is :
<ol>
<li>declare lots of local variables to store geometries
(for the widget itself, and all its children).
This is necessary to implement test mode.
<li>
initialise all local variables to reflect the current geometry
of the relevant widget
<li>
initialise the specific variables that reflect the instigator
with its geometry
<li>
see how big the manager widget must be
<li>
if we're allowed to (ParentResize), ask whether we can resize ourselves
to the geometry we need
<li>
resize ourselves (if applicable)
<li>
layout all children widgets
<li>
return information to the caller
</ol>
