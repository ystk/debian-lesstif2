Feedback
</H1>

We are <EM>really</EM> interested in your opinion about our project
(and our webpages perhaps ;-)
<br>
Send any questions or comments regarding the LessTif software
package and this website to the
<STRONG>mailing list</STRONG> at
<a href="mailto:lesstif-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net"><EM>lesstif-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net</EM></A>
<P>
However if you are going to report a specific <EM>bug</EM>
in our
<A HREF="versions.html">recent distributions</A>,
consider to use our
<A HREF="bugs.html#WhereToSend">SF bug tracking</A>
facility for this. Advantage is that this creates an entry in
a database which prevents the report from being forgotten,
even if it can't be addressed immediately ...
<P>
Also please read the helpful comments in
<A HREF="bugs.html">bugs.html</A> and, of course, our
<A HREF="FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</A>!
<BR>
More information (e.g. how to subscribe) about our mailinglists
can be found on
<A HREF="lists.html">another page</A>.
