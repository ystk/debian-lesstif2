<em>The LessTif project needs your help:</em>
<br>
We need to more fully document
the remaining differences between OSF/Motif and LessTif, so we're
looking for people who have access to OSF/Motif on some platforms, but
use LessTif under others.  If you use LessTif and feel like
contributing something back, but don't know where to begin, here's
your chance.

<p>
Right now, we're initiating a campaign to document the numerous test
programs that are supplied with a LessTif source distribution, and
particularly to document behavioral differences between OSF/Motif and
LessTif of these test programs.

<p>We need volunteers to help.  All you need is access to on official
OSF/Motif implementation, the LessTif sources, and a little time.  Please
consider helping the LessTif project achieve its goal of Motif 1.2
compatibility. 


<p>We're looking both for people who will commit to "owning" a test tree
and making sure that the information in it is current, and people who are
only able to test things out once (testers).  The time commitment involved
in being a test "owner" can be large or small, as you can sign up for as
many or as few of the test directories as you wish.

<p>If you wish to become an owner, choose a few directories to work on,
and register your choices here. (for now, just send us
<a href="feedback.html">an email</a>).  If you're willing/able to fix any
problems with LessTif you encounter, perhaps it'd be best to choose tests
for those widgets with which you're most familiar, but ultimately all the
tests need to be documented.

<p><b>Detailed instructions:</b>

<p>Owners and testers will need to put LessTif on the machine where you
have OSF/Motif (this can be done in your home directory, it needn't be
installed globally).  Run <tt>./configure --with-motif</tt> from the
top-level LessTif directory to create makefiles which will build both
Motif and LessTif versions.  In the test directories, you can use "make"
to make the LessTif versions of the tests and then "make motif-tests" to
make the Motif versions. After you've compiled both Motif and LessTif
versions of the tests, compare the appearance and behavior of each one,
and write up a SUMMARY file of the results.</p>

Click <a href="test_policy.html">here</a> for instructions on creating and
updating summary files, or <a href="test_summary.html">here</a> for an
example.
<p>

Thanks!
