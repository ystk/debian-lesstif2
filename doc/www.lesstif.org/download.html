Downloading LessTif
</H1>
All the LessTif software packages are assembled nicely on the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8596"> files section</A>
of our <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge.Net</A>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lesstif">project page</A>.
<P>
The easiest way to get started if you're a Linux user with a traditional PC
is to grab all four of the binary RPM files, as described in the table below.
This means that you should grab and install <strong>all of the lesstif-*.i386.rpm files</strong>.
You can choose to install a subset of those four files,
but we continue to get questions about that.
<P>
Other places that offer these files include the Hungry FTP server
(<a href="ftp://ftp.hungry.com/pub/hungry/lesstif/">ftp.hungry.com</a>)
and its 
<a href="mirrors.html"><STRONG>mirrors</STRONG></a>.
<p>
Those who want to use the most up to date software can choose
to use the bleeding edge version,
directly out of our <A HREF="cvs.html">CVS</A>.

<p>
If you have <STRONG>trouble</STRONG> with a specific release, you may
wish to see the <a href="known.html">known problems</a> file.
<BR>
<STRONG>
Also make sure you have read the
<A HREF="FAQ.html">FAQ</A> as well as the
<A HREF="INSTALL.html">Installation instructions</A>!
<BR>
You should check these files before sending mail to the developers.

<BR>
Also you could download there source and binary releases older than
the current ones, but why should anybody do that? :-)
<P>
<H2>Thank you</H2>
Thanks to the free software community,
and especially to SuSE for providing the tools needed
to build all this wonderful software.
The binary RPM's of recent releases of LessTif have all been built
under SuSE Linux.
