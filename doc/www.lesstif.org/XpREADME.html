<H2>1.0  X Print Service Overview</H2>
<P>
The "X Print Service" technology allows X rendering to devices such as
printers and fax.  Most of the service is available in the X11
technology stack as Xp, with the remainder in the CDE technology stack
as DtPrint.  Modifications have also been made to the Motif technology
stack to support Xp and DtPrint.
<P>
The Xp portion consists of:
<UL>
<LI>Xp Extension for the X-Server (included in the X-Server Xprt)
<LI>Xp Extension API for the client side (libXp)
<LI>PCL ddx driver that converts core X to native PCL
<LI>Postscript ddx driver that converts core X to native Postscript
<LI>Raster ddx driver that generates xwd rasters which can be
     converted to PCL or Postscript rasters
</UL>
<P>
The DtPrint portion consists of:
<UL>
<LI>A collection of print GUIs (libDtPrint)
<LI>A Print Dialog Manager that can assist a client in
     setting printing options (dtpdm, dtpdmd)
</UL>
<P>
From an X clients perspective, it can attach to one of two nearly
identical X-Servers, a "Video" X-Server, and a "Print" X-Server
which has the additional Xp capability but otherwise looks and
behaves the same.

<H2>2.0  How the X Print Service Works</H2>
<P>
The X Print Service expands on the traditional X-Server and Xlib world
in four ways.
<OL>
<LI>Most obvious is the use of "print ddx drivers" instead of
   "video ddx drivers".  While a video ddx driver modifies pixels
   in a video frame buffer, a print ddx driver generates "page
   description language (PDL)" output such as PCL or Postscript.
<P>
   Once a print ddx driver generates PDL output, it can be sent to
   a spooler such as lp(1) or retrieved by the client.
<P>
   Though not currently done, a single X-Server can support both
   print and video ddx drivers.

<LI>Since printers support "paged" output, unlike video, a portion
   of the Xp Extension supports APIs to delineate printed output.
   For example, XpStartPage and XpEndPage tell the X-Server where
   a physical page starts and ends in an otherwise continuous
   stream of X rendering primitives.  Likewise, XpStartJob and
   XpEndJob determine when a collection of pages starts and ends.
   XpEndJob typically causes the generated PDL to be submitted to
   a spooler, such as lp(1).

<LI>Since printers have extensive capabilities, another portion of
   the Xp Extension supports APIs to manipulate "print contexts".
<P>
   Once a printer is selected using the Xp Extension API, a print
   context to represent it can be created.  A print context
   embodies the printer selected - it contains the printer's
   default capabilities, selectable range of capabilities,
   printer state, and generated output.  Some "attributes" within
   the print context can be modified by the user, and the
   X-Server and print ddx driver will react accordingly.  For
   example, the attribute "content-orientation" can be set to
   "landscape" or "portrait".

<LI>Since printers can have "built in" fonts, the Xp Extension in
   the X-Server works with the print ddx drivers to make
   available (for printing only) additional fonts on a per print
   context basis.
<P>
   When a print context is created and set for a given printer,
   the X font calls may be able to access additional printer
   fonts.  To do this (typically), the X-Server must have access
   to "printer metric files" (.pmf) that describe at minimum the
   metrics of the built in fonts.
</OL>


<H2>3.0  Using the X Print Service</H2>
<P>
There are three tasks to start the X Print Service:  1) configuring the
X Print Server, 2) starting the X Print Service, 3) configuring the user
session so that clients can find the running X Print Service.
<P>
The tasks are described in detail below.


<H3>3.1  X Print Server Configuration</H3>
<P>
The X Print Server (Xprt) can read a number of configuration files which
control its behavior and support for printers.  Each vendor platform has
a default location for this information.  Xprt can also read the
environment variable XPCONFIGDIR to locate alternate configuration
directories.  Common settings include:
<UL>
<LI>export XPCONFIGDIR=/X11/lib/X11/XpConfig/
<LI>export XPCONFIGDIR=/proj/x11/xc/programs/Xserver/XpConfig/
</UL>
<P>
Xprt has many built-in defaults, and lacking any configuration files,
will immediately try to support all printers visible via lpstat(1).
<P>
In order of importance for configuration by a system administrator, the
configuration files for a "C" locale are as follows.
<PRE>
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/Xprinters

	`Xprinters' is the top most configuration file.  It tells
	Xprt which specific printer names (e.g.  mylaser) should
	be supported, and whether lpstat(1) or other commands
	should be used to automatically supplement the list of
        printers.

   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/printer

	The `printer' file maps printer names to model
	configurations (see `model-config' below).  For example,
	"mylaser" could be mapped to a "HPDJ1600C", and all other
	arbitrary printers could be mapped to a default, such as
	"HPLJ4SI".  When depending on lpstat(1) in the Xprinters
	file, setting up defaults in `printer' becomes all the
        more important.

   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document

	The `document' file specifies the initial document values
	for any print jobs.  For example, which paper tray to
	use, what default resolution, etc.

   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/job

	The `job' file specifies the initial job values for any
	print jobs.  For example, "notification-profile" can be
	set so that when a print job is successfully sent to a
	printer, e-mail is sent to the user.

   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/models/HPDJ1600C/model-config
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/models/HPDJ1600C/fonts/fonts.dir
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/models/HPDJ1600C/fonts/9nb00051.pmf
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/models/HPDJ1600C/fonts/9nb00093.pmf

	The `model-config' file has attributes that describe the
	printer model's capabilities and default settings.
	Printer model fonts may also be present.  The model-config
        file also identifies the print ddx driver to be used.

	For each printer model supported, a complete hierarchy of
	files should exist.  In most cases, these files do not
	need to be modified.

   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/ddx-config/raster/pcl
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/ddx-config/raster/postscript

	The print ddx drivers can have highly specific
	configuration files to control their behavior.  In most
	cases, these files do not need to be modified.
</PRE>

<H3>3.2  Starting the X Print Service</H3>
<P>
The summary checklist for starting the X Print Service is as follows:
<OL>
<LI>Choose an execution model for the X Print Service.  The X
   Print Service can be run on a per-user session basis, per
   machine basis, or can be run on a few machines globally
   available to a number of users.

<LI>If print jobs are to be submitted to a spooler (almost always
   the case), make sure all needed printers are available to the
   spooler subsystem (most often lp(1)) on the same machine
   running the X Print Service.

<LI>Configure the X Print Server.  See ``X Print Server
   Configuration''.

<LI>Depending on #1, start the X Print Server process "Xprt", and
   then the Print Dialog Manager Daemon process "dtpdmd" at the
   appropriate times.
</OL>
The details are described below.
<P>
Because the X Print Service is based on X, it can be easily distributed.
The most significant factors in which execution model to choose will be
driven by:
<UL>
<LI>how many printers will be accessable through the printer
     subsystem on any given machine.  A system administrator may
     choose to cluster printers on a few given machines, or
     scatter them across an organization and possibly make
     extensive use of remote spoolers to make them globally
     available.

<LI>how many machines will need a copy of the X Print Server
     configuration files.  The files have been architected so
     that one super-set version of them can be maintained and
     distributed (e.g.  via NFS), and a per-machine or per-user
     version of the `Xprinters' is all that is needed to have the
     appropriate information in them utilized or ignored.

<LI>how many users can demand services from a given X Print
     Service.
</UL>
With the above in mind, some obvious execution models include:
<UL>
<LI> Global - in this model, the system administrator is choosing
     to run the X Print Service on a *few* select machines with
     appropriate printers configured, and allow clients access to
     the global resource.  This can centralize the administration
     of printers and configuration files, but may have to be
     monitored for performance loading.
<P>
     Startup would likely be done by boot-up scripts.

<LI> Per-machine - every machine with potential X Print Service
     users would run the service.  Printer and configuration file
     administration is decentralized, and usage would be limited
     to the users on the machine.
<P>
     Startup would likely be done by boot-up scripts.

<LI> Per-user session - every user would run an entire X Print
     Service for themselves.  In the future, the Video X Server
     normally started may contain Print X Server capability, so
     this model becomes very natural.
<P>
     Startup would likely be done at session login or by
     launching actions or processes manually once the user
     logs in.  Note: the dtpdmd must be started after Xprt.
</UL>
Starting of the processes is straight forward.  In strict order:
<PRE>
   [machineA] % Xprt [-XpFile &lt;Xprinters file&gt;] [:dispNum] &amp;

      Note that Xprt will look for configuration files in either
      a default location or where XPCONFIGDIR points.

      -XpFile specifies an alternate `Xprinters' file, rather
      than the default one or `${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/Xprinters'.

   [machineA] % dtpdmd -d machineA[:dispNum] [-l /tmp/dtpdmd.log] &amp;

      The dtpdmd will maintain an X-Selection on the X-Server,
      and will start dtpdm's as required to service requests.
</PRE>
In all but the per-user session model, the machine running the dtpdmd
(thus dtpdm's) will need display authorization to the users video
display.



<H3>3.3  Configuring the environment</H3>
<P>
Once a X Print Server and dtpdmd have been started -- many of them
in some cases -- clients will need to find and use them.  There are
two mechanisms that allow clients to discover X Print Servers and
printers.
<UL>
<LI> "X Print Specifier" - assuming usage of the DtPrint print
     dialogs, the following notation is understood:
<PRE>
          printer_name@machine[:dispNum]
</PRE>
     For example:
<PRE>
          colorlj7@printhub:2
</PRE>
     In the above example, the X Print Server running at `printhub:2'
     is assumed to support the printer named `colorlj7'.

<LI> "XPSERVERLIST" - assuming usage of the DtPrint print dialogs,
     the environment variable "XPSERVERLIST" can contain a list
     of X Print Servers.  For example:
<PRE>
          XPSERVERLIST="printhub:2 printhub:3 otherdept:0"
</PRE>
     Then in the dialogs, only a printer name needs to be entered.
     The dialog will then search the X Print Servers in XPSERVERLIST
     for a server than supports the printer, and then establish
     contact.
</UL>
<H3>3.4  General End-User Sequence</H3>
<P>
From most CDEnext applications, printing is accomplished by bringing
down the &lt;File&gt; menu and selecting &lt;Print...&gt;.  This will result in
the DtPrintSetupBox dialog, which will request the name of a printer,
and offer limited capability to configure print options (e.g. number
of copies).  If the user wishes, they can select &lt;Setup...&gt;, which
will start a dtpdm capable of modifying additional print options.
Finally, the user should select &lt;Print&gt;.
