<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Introduction</H2>

This document details configuring, compiling, and installing LessTif
on various platforms.
<P>
The original version of this document is written in HTML;
the LessTif build process uses one of the text mode web browsers
<A HREF="http://lynx.browser.org">lynx</A>
or
<A HREF="http://links.browser.org">links</A>
to convert it into plain text.
Both the HTML (<CODE>doc/www.lesstif.org/INSTALL.html</CODE>)
and the plain text (<CODE>Install</CODE>) formats should be in a distribution.
<P>
Readers that are going to install a binary version of LessTif
can jump to the according
<A HREF="#Binary_distributions_of_LessTif">section</A>
immediately.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</A>
(What you need to compile LessTif)</H3>

To build LessTif from the sources you need a number of installed
software packages and utilities.
You can find pointers to most of these tools on our
<A HREF="links.html#tools">links page</A>. 

<ul>
<li> C development system
     including an ANSI C89 (or better) <em>compiler</em>
     such as <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">gcc</a>
     and an according <em>C library</em>
<li> the <i>make</i> build tool
<li> X Window System (X11 Release 6 or higher; R5 might still work as well,
     but is no longer supported):
     libraries and headers
<li> some UN*X standard tools, like
     <CODE>cp</CODE>, <CODE>cp</CODE>, <CODE>install</CODE>, <CODE>rm</CODE>, 
     <CODE>sed</CODE>
</ul>
<BR>
In addition when building from CVS instead of using our source tarballs you 
will need:
<UL>
<li> autoconf
<li> automake 
<li> libtool 
<li> yacc (GNU bison)
<li> (f)lex
</ul>

<A HREF="#LessTif_from_CVS">Below</A> we specify which versions
of the auto* tools are required.

<P>
A large variety of systems fulfill these requirements as our
(incomplete!) list of
<A HREF="platforms.html">supported platforms</A> shows.
And installing the missing software shouldn't be too hard 
(except for the compiler and X11, perhaps ;-)


<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Configuring_LessTif">Configuring LessTif</A></H3>

<P>
Configuration of LessTif is now handled by
<a href="links.html#tools">automake, autoconf and libtool</A>.
They are GNU development tools which the LessTif developers use
to generate the distribution's build scripts and makefiles.
Normally this shouldn't bother you.
<P>
If you obtained a copy of LessTif from our 
<a href="cvs.html">CVS repository</a>,
then you need to perform some additional steps which will create the 
"configure" script and all the "Makefile.in" files (and some other
files).
<EM>configure</EM> is a shell script which is meant to be run by people 
who compile LessTif (you, probably). It looks at your system and tries to
figure out how exactly to compile. It may need a little help through 
command-line options, though.


<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="LessTif_from_CVS">LessTif from CVS</A></H3>

<P>
If you obtained your LessTif sources directly from CVS, you'll have to perform 
some of the steps which the LessTif developers normally perform when creating 
a distribution. (So, if you did get a real distribution you don't need to do 
this and you can go on to the next section.)
<P>
The following table lists the current versions of the 
auto* tools which we use currently for development. 
Note that the latest <EM>official</EM> release may still be based on a 
different set!
<BR>

<TABLE BORDER=1 ALIGN=CENTER>
<TR>
<TH>
Tool
<TH>
Version
<TR>
<TD>
automake
<TD>
1.9.6
<TR>
<TD>
autoconf
<TD>
2.63 (2.50 at least)
<TR>
<TD>
libtool
<TD>
2.2.6
</TABLE>
<P>
We have two places where you need to run the auto* commands.
These are
<UL>
<LI>$LESSTIF (the main directory)
<LI>$LESSTIF/test (large number of tests for our libraries)
</UL>
<P>
The whole process of running the auto tools and make is now automated
by the <I>CVSMake</I> script which is present in LessTif's top directory.
Use of CVSMake is mandatory! Don't bother us if you run the auto* tools
in your own way and run into problems afterwards ...
<br>
Note that due to a bug in current versions of those tools you may see
an error or warning message while running CVSMake.
(<I>In some versions,
it'll complain about installing some files in the LessTif directories,
in other versions, it says AC_PROG_LEX is called multiple times.</I>)
<BR>
If things run well afterwards you may ignore this, of course.
(so please try to continue first!)
<P>
CVSMake needs to be run in the top source directory of LessTif,
it figures out which directories need its attention and then does its thing. 
After running CVSMake, the source tree should be ready for running the
configure command.
<P>
The CVSMake scripts now feature some command line flags which
may be useful:
<ul>
<li>
<CODE>clean</CODE>
by default CVSMake cleans up a couple of files in the current
toplevel directory. If this flag is specified it tries to
run <CODE>make maintainer-clean</CODE>
<li>
<code>local</code> -
if applied to the toplevel CVSMake it won't run recurse
into the non-core directories (<CODE>test/</CODE>)
<li>
<code>nodist</code> -
enables generation of dependencies in Makefiles.
This does only work on systems which are supported by 
<a href="links.html#tools">GNU automake/libtool</a>.
Starting with automake 1.5 finally more compilers than just
gcc are supported!
</UL>

<P>
Note that you may get a warning about the INSTALL file missing in some cases.
Don't worry, it is now a generated file.
If you have Lynx/links on your system, it'll convert doc/INSTALL.html
into INSTALL. This only happens during the build process
(and we're now in the configuration phase which is still before the build);
that's why you can get this message. By the way: it's harmless.
<P>
The commands above are also the commands that you need to run
if you have modified some of the Makefiles yourself.
<P>
Once you've done all the above, you can continue with the next section.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="LessTif_source_distribution">LessTif source distribution</A></H3>

<P>
To configure LessTif for your system, just type 'configure'.
This should do a reasonable job of locating the stuff it needs,
and gives rather verbose output should something fail.
<P>
The configure script has a lot of command line options
which you might need or want to use for two main reasons :
<UL>
<LI>the configure program doesn't work (well) for you
<LI>you want to tune the LessTif build process
</UL>
<P>
You can type
<PRE>
      configure --help
</PRE>
to get the list of all options, with a short description of each.
We'll cover most if not all of the options in the next sections
of this document.

<H4><A NAME="find_everything">Getting configure to find everything</A></H4>

configure identifies a large number of aspects of your computer system,
it checks for all those <A HREF="#Prerequisites">prerequisites</A>
listed above.
<BR>
Two things that configure looks for on your machine are:
<UL>
<LI>X11 headers and libraries
<LI>Motif&reg; headers and libraries (optional)
</UL>
<P>
Now many people who have Motif&reg; on their system don't use LessTif.
Hmm. Wonder why that is.
Anyway, it wouldn't make much sense if you needed Motif&reg; in order to
build LessTif.
The good news is: you don't need it.
The only reason why you can tell configure where to find Motif&reg;
is so it can configure the Makefiles under test/
to be capable of building LessTif as well as Motif&reg; tests.
<P>
configure will tell you where it has found them if it found them.
If it didn't find X, you'll have to specify the path on configure's
command line. Use these two options:
<PRE>
--x-includes
--x-libraries
</PRE>
<P>
And to specify the Motif&reg; stuff, use these:
<PRE>
--with-motif-includes
--with-motif-libraries
</PRE>
To specify the location of the various bits,
you have to set these flags equal to something.
An example on how to do this is:
<PRE>
configure --x-includes=/usr/local/X11R6/include
</PRE>
The other flags behave identically.  

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="tune_the_build">Using configure options to tune the build</A></H3>

As of LessTif 0.87.2 the build system is capable of building multiple
LessTif libraries. The purpose of this is to have several libraries
that are compatible with several releases of OSF/Motif&reg;.
<BR>
Starting in 2002 (with 0.93.3) we install our Motif 2.1 version by default. 
Starting mid 2004 (with 0.93.96) we removed support for 1.2 and 2.0.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Compiling_LessTif">Compiling LessTif</A></H3>

After configuring LessTif, just typing 'make' should build all the libraries, 
clients, and (optionally) tests for LessTif.
<P>
Some combinations of compilers and libraries may have code generation bugs.
If you see weird problems when you debug library code,
try a lower (or no) optimization.
For the vast majority who compile with the default flags this is not an issue.


<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Building_Platforms">Platform specific issues</A></H3>

Here we collect various hints and workarounds which may help in building 
on the specific platforms. Many are a bit outdated, since we usually try to
get fixes in our configuration system to avoid such workarounds.
However they may still be useful to resolve similar problems!

<H4><A NAME="compile_DU">OSF, Digital Unix, Tru64</A></H4>

Building on Digital Unix from scratch/CVS using the system's CC compiler
is known to work after installing flex 2.5.4 and starting configure like
<pre>
CC="cc -std1" LEX="/usr/local/bin/flex" ./configure
</pre>
Building releases (i.e. source distributions) doesn't require
an installation of flex, and versions from 0.92.32 should even
work without specifying the "-std1" compiler flag.

<H4>
<A NAME="compile_HPUX">HP/UX</A>
</H4>

On an HP/UX system that we have access to,
the commands that we used to configure LessTif are :
<PRE>
    CC="cc -Ae"
    export CC
    ./configure --disable-static
</PRE>

<H4><A NAME="compile_OS2">OS/2</A></H4>

If you want to build LessTif for XFree86 OS/2 you have to use specific
Makefiles since a build based on the auto*-tools/libtool is not
possible (based on recent auto* tools and their ports you may give them
a try, of course. However it's not worthwhile and would require quite some 
work to get a satisfying result). They are available from
<A HREF="http://homepages.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/lesstif.html">
http://homepages.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/lesstif.html</A>.
<BR>
The LessTif DLLs export their interfaces via name and ordinal. 
Compatibility to older versions is ensured by using the 
<CODE>mkdef_emx.cmd</CODE> script (see <CODE>scripts/OS2/</CODE>).
<BR>
Those Makefiles don't support building the supplied example programs
in the <CODE>test/</CODE> tree yet. If you want to easily build some of them 
check out the REXX script "ble.cmd" in <CODE>scripts/OS2/</CODE>.
<BR>
Further OS/2-specific problems are addressed within the according section
of our <A HREF="FAQ.html#Platform_OS2">FAQ</A>.

<H4><A NAME="compile_SOLARIS">Solaris</A></H4>

On some older SunOS systems without proper ANSI C support you need to 
<PRE>
#define VOID_SPRINTF
</PRE>
to get the code built. You might put it in by hand in the <CODE>config.h</CODE>.

<P>

On a Sun Solaris 2.6 SPARC with the SUNWspro compiler. 
In order to get past an undefined _Xconst in lesstif-0.88.1/lib/Xm/AtomMgr.c, I
hacked in the following lines at the front of lesstif-0.88.1/include/LTconf.h:
<pre>
#define FUNCPROTO 1
#include &lt;X11/Xfuncproto.h&gt;
</pre>
(This might be obsolete meanwhile)


<H4><A NAME="compile_Windows">Windows</A></H4>

For a long time, LessTif had to be built as static libraries on the Windows
platform. (Initially there were several versions of un*x support on Windows,
now only Cygwin gets mentioned a lot.)
Since October 2003, LessTif is available as shared library on Cygwin.
<P>
LessTif compiles almost out of the box under Cygwin.  However you will need
to install XFree86 4.x or higher from
<A HREF="http://xfree86.cygwin.com">http://xfree86.cygwin.com</A>.
<P>
For U/WIN you will need to install GCC, libtools, automake, and autoconf
etc.  Please check the URL
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.xraylith.wisc.edu/pub/khan/gnu-win32/uwin/">ftp://ftp.xraylith.wisc.edu/pub/khan/gnu-win32/uwin/</A>.
<P>
For Interix, you will need GCC from Microsoft Interix URL.  After installing
GCC, download automake, autoconf and libtools, compile and install them.

<A HREF="#tune_the_build">related options</A>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Binary_distributions_of_LessTif">Binary distributions of LessTif</A></H3>

Binary versions of LessTif are built and made available as a service to
people who want to use LessTif without having to compile it themselves.
As we're concentrating on developing and improving LessTif itself,
we consider binary releases to be a side product,
which we only generate once in a while - generally at each minor release.
Our release policy is detailed in
<A HREF="release-policy.html">release-policy.html</A>.
<P>
Binary versions usually exist for Linux (various versions), FreeBSD
and OS/2, others may be created occasionally as well, e.g. Windows binaries
based on Cygwin.
<P>
Specifically for Linux,
the binaries that we provide are RPM files.
A LessTif release has more than one RPM file,
each containing a part of LessTif.
The <A HREF="download.html">Download page</A>
explains the difference between them.
Important to know is that the "main" RPM is really only a runtime,
whereas the stuff needed for development is in a separate RPM.


<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Installing_Platforms">Platform specific issues</A></H3>

<H4><A NAME="bin_FreeBSD">FreeBSD</A></H4>
<P>
Starting with the 0.80a (0.80 pre-release),
the FreeBSD binary distribution is provided as a pkg_add installable file.
<P>
Pkg_add(8) is FreeBSD's installation tool.
<P>
Installation of LessTif with pkg_add creates a directory /usr/lesstif,
under which all of LessTif is placed.
As the file /usr/lesstif/README explains,
you should put /usr/lesstif/bin in your $path,
add /usr/lesstif/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
to the options of ldconfig in /etc/rc,
and point your compiler to include files and libraries by adding
<PRE>
    -I/usr/lesstif/include -L/usr/lesstif/lib
</PRE>
to its command line. See also <A HREF="#After_LessTif">below</A>.

From Matthew Simpson (matthewsimpson@home.com)
<P>
LessTif Binary Installation
<P>
The following procedure worked for installing the binary version 0.82 
LessTif onto my Redhat 4.2 Linux system. I did not have a previous 
installation of either the source or binary LessTif, so this works from 
scratch. I am documenting this days later, so please correct as needed. 
The binary installation is simple:
<OL>
<LI>After downloading the binary distribution, log in as root and place 
the file in /usr
<LI>gunzip it:
<CODE>
gunzip lesstif-0.82-linux.tar.gz
</CODE>
<LI>untar it:
<CODE>
tar -xvf lesstif-0.82-linux.tar
</CODE>
The result will be this directory:
<CODE>
/usr/lesstif
</CODE>
<LI>Remove the tar file if desired:
<CODE>
rm lesstif-0.82-linux.tar 
</CODE>
<LI>Edit
<CODE>/etc/ld.so.conf</CODE>
and add the following line for the untarred LessTif library:
<PRE>
/usr/lesstif/lib
</PRE>
<LI>Run this:
<CODE>
ldconfig
</CODE>
<P>
LessTif Window Manager:
<P>
To ignore your default window manager and instead load mwm, make or copy 
these files as yourself or root (whichever you use) to your home directory:

<LI>Put a .xinitrc file in your home directory. Add this to the last line, 
replacing the call to any other window manager:
<PRE>
eval "exec /usr/lesstif/bin/mwm" 
</PRE>
Or for better tracking, use this line instead:
<PRE>
eval "exec /usr/lesstif/bin/mwm" -debug &gt;"$HOME"/.MWM-errors 2&gt;&amp;1
</PRE>
(The redirections rules for <CODE>&gt;</CODE> and <CODE>2&gt;&amp;1</CODE>
syntax are specific to sh, which is what my startx script uses.
The rules are slightly different for  tcsh.) This will dump any errors to a 
file in your home directory called <CODE>.MWM-errors</CODE>.
If no errors occur, this file will not get created. If this file already exists,
new errors will be appended to it. To get a new file each time you log in or
start X,
add this to your <CODE>.login</CODE> or <CODE>startx</CODE> file:
<PRE>
rm -f $HOME/.MWM-errors
</PRE>
To automatically execute your window manager upon login, add this to the
end of your .login file (this is using tcsh syntax):
<PRE>
if ( ! -e /tmp/.X0-lock ) then
echo "Starting X Windows..."
rm -f $HOME/.MWM-errors
startx
endif
</PRE>

<LI>Copy this:
<BR>
<CODE>
cp /usr/lesstif/lib/X11/app-defaults/Mwm . 
</CODE>
<BR>
This is where you set your personal app-defaults. Uncomment the lines 
mentioned at the end of this file to get some pretty borders. Here are 
some other things I changed:
Double clicking an icon was set too fast. To slow it down:
<BR>
<CODE>
Mwm*doubleClickTime:            1000 
</CODE>
<BR>
To allow automatic window focus whenever the mouse pointer hits it:
<BR>
<CODE>
Mwm*keyboardFocusPolicy:        pointer
</CODE>

<LI>Copy this to your home directory:
<BR>
<CODE>
cp /usr/lesstif/lib/X11/mwm/system.mwmrc .mwmrc 
</CODE>
<BR>
(Note that you should rename it from system.mwmrc to .mwmrc)
This is where you set up your personal root menus. If you use XFree86, 
look in <CODE>/usr/X11R6/bin</CODE> for most of the already-installed
applications you like to execute through the root window pull-down menus.
More menus and sub-menus can be added as desired. Since
<CODE>/usr/X11R6/bin</CODE> is in your path, you need not type the full
path names into <CODE>.mwmrc</CODE>. Applications in other directories will
need paths or soft links set up. 
<P>
When setting up these two files I did not have a LessTif mwm manual page 
available. However, if you have Unix and Motif&reg; available at work
(such as on SGI products), just do a <CODE>man mwm</CODE> and print it
out for reference. Most will apply to LessTif mwm. (Even though SGI uses
their own version called 4Dwm, they still provide the mwm manual pages
with the IRIX 6.2 release.)

<LI>run <CODE>startx</CODE>
</OL>
Hope this helps someone. These directions may be over simplified, but I
wanted to be specific. Thanks for LessTif. I am learning M*tif but have
a long way to go.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="bin_OS2">OS/2</A></H4>

The OS/2 binary distribution is provided as a Zip file.
Put it into your <CODE>X11ROOT</CODE> directory and unzip the archive. 
This installs all libraries and executables (Xm.dll, Xm_20.dll, mwm.exe, ...).
It puts everything in place to be used within a valid XFree86 OS/2

First 
install Cygwin/Xfree86 in /usr/X11R6 from
<A href="http://xfree86.cygwin.com">http://xfree86.cygwin.com</A>
Then copy lesstif-0.92.98-cygwin.tar.bz2 to \cygwin directory and open Cygwin
bash shell:
<PRE>
cd /
bunzip2 lesstif-0.92.98.tar.bz2
tar xvf lesstif-0.92.98.tar
</PRE>
You should be set to go.


<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="After_LessTif">After LessTif (Getting shared libraries to work)</A></H3>

Shared library configuration differs from system to system.  Here is the
lowdown on getting them to work on the systems that support them.

<UL>
<LI>Linux
<BR>
There are two ways to have shared libraries available under linux:
	<UL>
	<LI>Use the <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> environment variable.
	<LI>Use <CODE>ldconfig</CODE>.
	</UL>
The second option is only available to those with superuser access, so
if you don't, or you specifically want to use the library that was just
built (for running the tests), use the <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> variable.  
<P>
The <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> variable is to contain a colon separated
list of paths to be searched for shared libraries. This variable is consulted 
before the information compiled by ldconfig, so even if you have LessTif 
already installed on your system you can use this variable to force the 
use of the newly built library. Below is an example:
<P>
Assume you told configure to install LessTif in your home directory
"/home/lesstifuser". To keep any existing settings in that
variable we put our new setting in front of older ones. The syntax
used below assumes that you're usig a bash shell:
<PRE>
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/lesstifuser:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</PRE>
In case you didn't specify any prefix check where
"make install" actually puts the libraries.
<BR>
If you have superuser access and want LessTif to be installed for 
system-wide use, make sure the directory to which the libraries were 
installed is listed in <CODE>/etc/ld.so.conf</CODE>.  Then (as root) type 
<PRE>ldconfig -v</PRE>
to make them available.
<P>
If you're not sure which library is being used (either the system-wide
installed one, or one you've just compiled), use the 'ldd' command.  After
generating an executable linked dynamically with LessTif, type 
<code>ldd &lt;executable-name&gt;</code>.
This will output a list of the paths to all the shared libraries
this executable depends on.

<LI>HPUX 9
<BR>
Nothing additional needs to be done. Just make sure the linker can
find the libraries when generating the executable (the -L flag).


<LI>NetBSD/FreeBSD/OpenBSD
<BR>
Same as for Linux.

</H2>

<H3>
<A NAME="DefaultVersions">Default versions</A>
</H3>

Usually upgrading LessTif from one version to
the other is a rather simple task.
The challenge is to recognize that the default version
of our libraries has changed in the past.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1 ALIGN=CENTER>

	<TD>&lt;0.92

</TABLE>

<H3><A NAME="InstallationTree">Installation Tree</A></H3>

Starting from 0.93.5 we changed the way that LessTif install its files. 
Earlier releases used to put most of their stuff libraries/headers in their 
own subdirectory $(prefix)/LessTif and afterwards create symbolic links for 
libraries and headers. Advantage was that people could more easily switch
between different installed versions, i.e. from "Motif 1.2" to "Motif 2.0".
Drawback was that this couldn't be done in a fully portable fashion,
i.e. at least installation from sources failed on some systems
though they were supported by libtool (which is the more crucial factor 
which limits portability: we can only build our libraries on systems which
are supported by this powerful tool, see section
<A HREF="#Prerequisites">Prerequisites</A>).
<P>
To simplify this whole process for the maintainers (who have to deal 
with all the bug reports ;-) and to enhance portability we abandoned 
this approach. We now install directly in the proper directories below
$(prefix) and only put documentation and non-Motif standard
stuff in $(prefix)/LessTif.
<P>
Having said this we have to acknowledge that upgrading an
older release to 0.93.5 (or better) may fail for some reasons:
installation tools may fail or refuse to remove the old symbolic
links to now obsolete locations.
So before doing the upgrade remove your whole old $(prefix)/LessTif
tree and in addition the following symbolic links (if they exist)
below $(prefix).
However ensure that you know und understand what you are doing,
don't remove a non-LessTif installation this way!
(e.g. if your system has libraries with a different extension
than <CODE>.so</CODE> those links were not created by a LessTif installation
from sources, but perhaps a very different installation!)

The Xlt and Xbae widget sets are two widget sets that used to come with
LessTif distributions, but that aren't part of the Motif&reg; clone.
Accordingly we finally removed them from the LessTif distribution
and promoted them to stand-alone projects which have their own CVS repositories!
