<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Release Policy
</H1>

<CODE>Sunday, April 16, 2000</CODE>:
<p>
The policy for releases is as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Major (or public) releases will have an extension
that is divisible by 0.05 (e.g., 0.75, 0.80, 0.85).
Major releases are expected to be stable.
<li>
Minor (or development) releases will have an extension
that is divisible by .01 (e.g., 0.71, 0.72, 0.73).
<li>
As of release 0.90.0,
the "pico" version number (the third number) also carries a meaning :
<BR>
only even numbers are used for releases, the odd numbers are the
development versions between releases.
<br>
This means 0.90.1 is a development version (not a release),
0.90.2 is probably the release to follow 0.90.0.
<li>
There has been a time in which minor releases were not very stable.
Writing this is tempting the odds,
but minor releases have been stable for a long time,
we expect them to remain so.
<li>
Releases will be accompanied by announcements to
comp.windows.x.motif and various newsgroups and newsfeeds.
</ol>
Thanks for your continuing support...
