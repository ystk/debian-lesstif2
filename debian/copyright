This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of LessTif, the Hungry
Programmers' version of OSF/Motif. LessTif is intended to be source code
compatible with Motif 1.2, meaning that the same source will compile with
both libraries and work exactly the same.

This package was originally put together by Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>;
maintenance was taken over by Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>, and
then by Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>.   It was then taken over by
Herbert Xu <herbert@debian.org>.

The sources for LessTif were retrieved from
  http://www.lesstif.org/
