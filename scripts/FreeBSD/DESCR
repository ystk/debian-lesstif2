LessTif is a clone of the Motif toolkit; it's aiming for OSF/Motif® 1.2
compatibility initially.

Currently LessTif is partially implemented with most of the API in place.

Many free Motif-based applications run with LessTif quite well already.
A list of those is on the LessTif web pages at http://www.lesstif.org .
